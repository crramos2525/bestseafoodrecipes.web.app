<h5 id="steps-to-make-oven-steamed-sea-trout">Steps to make Oven steamed sea trout:</h5>
<ol>
<li>If you’re a lucky owner of an oven with moisture injection function (but not steam oven), just set the oven to the appropriate programme at 130C/250F. The rest of us proceed as below.</li>
<li>Rinse and pat dry the sea trout sides, and cut them into portions of about 150g per person.</li>
<li>Preheat the oven to 130C/250F/gas ½.</li>
<li>Arrange one rack in the top half of the oven, with another rack in the bottom half, with space enough to put a cast iron skillet or a frying pan on the lower shelf.</li>
<li>Pick the samphire off the toughest, woody stems and rinse with cold water. Place it in a pan with enough water to cover it.</li>
<li>Season the sea trout with the smoked salt and pepper, drizzle with lemon juice and olive oil and arrange on a thin baking sheet. Sprinkle half the dill over the fish.</li>
<li>Boil water in a cast iron skillet or a heavy frying pan and put in the oven on the lower rack; place the fish on the top rack and close the oven door immediately.</li>
<li>Bake the trout for 10 minutes; it will turn very pale pink. In the meantime bring the samphire to the boil, drain, return to the pan and keep warm.</li>
<li>Serve the trout fillets on a bed of samphire, sprinkled with the reserved dill and with the lemon quarters on the side.</li>
</ol>
<p>Wrap fish in a single layer of cheesecloth, and place in a fish poacher or on a rack in a baking pan. Baking trout isn't difficult and is an excellent way to retain the flavor and healthy qualities of the fish. The aroma of fresh, steaming trout is intoxicating. Gently pulled off the bone with a fork, and eaten only with some crusty bread dipped in. Fold each piece of parchment in half; open and place one trout fillet, skin-side down, close to the fold.</p>
