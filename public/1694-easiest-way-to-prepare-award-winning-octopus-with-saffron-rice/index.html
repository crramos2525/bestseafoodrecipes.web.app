<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-octopus-with-saffron-rice">The ingredients needed to make Octopus with saffron rice:</h5>
<ol>

</ol>
<p>White rice is sauteed in butter and then simmered with saffron infused water. Indian saffron is richer, darker in its red-orange color then the Spanish or Italian, and gives a better flavor to rice. The saffron should always be steeped in hot water ahead of time and used as part of the liquid in the. Spicy stir-fried octopus, called nakji-bokkeum in Korean, is loved by many Koreans.</p>

<h5 id="instructions-to-make-octopus-with-saffron-rice">Instructions to make Octopus with saffron rice:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Wash the octopus and slowly cook in its washing water and its own juices for 30 to 40 minutes until tender. If you add more water no matter how long you cook it, the octopus meat will be hard.</li>
<li>Drain the octopus and slice it in biteful sizes.</li>
