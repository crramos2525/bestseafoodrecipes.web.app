Add a little more Oil, cook Chicken or Pork (or other meat), if you use any, and Onion (Shallots), Garlic, Ginger and Chilli, then add Prawns or Squid (or other seafood), if you use any, and stir-fry until almost cooked through.</li>

<li>Toss gently for about 1 minute, then add Spring Onion or Garlic Chives. Toss to combine then remove from heat.</li>
<li>Sprinkled with Peanuts, Coriander Leaves and extra Chilli only if you like them, and serve with Lime wedges.</li>
</ol>
