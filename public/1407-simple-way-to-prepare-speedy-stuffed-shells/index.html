They're saucy, oh-so-cheesy, and loaded with a ricotta, spinach, and parmesan filling.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="instructions-to-make-stuffed-shells">Instructions to make Stuffed Shells:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Get the sauce cooking. Melt butter/margarine in medium pot (or slow cooker) on LOW HEAT, mince onions as fine as possible and add to pot with the butter. Let simmer for 2 minutes to blanch onions.</li>
<li>Mix dried basil with a 1/4 cup of water and microwave in a cup for 45 seconds. This will make a basil &quot;tea&quot;. Strain and add basil &quot;tea&quot; to the sauce.</li>
<li>Add cans of tomatoes, basil &quot;tea&quot;, pepper, sugar and 1/8 tsp. salt to pot and let simmer at least an hour (or two). Add more sugar if you like it sweeter.</li>
<li>Boil the shells and let cool being careful not to get them torn up.</li>
<li>Mix thourloughly the ricotta, parmesan, eggs, garlic powder, 4 oz. mozzarella and cleaned spinach (remove the stems!). I used about a quarter of a bag of spinach.</li>
<li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Add several ladles of the tomato sauce to a casserole dish. Stuff the shells with cheese mixture and line the casserole dish with stuffed shells.</li>
<li>Pour a few more ladles of the tomato sauce over the shells. Cover the dish with foil, poke a hole in the middle to vent. Be careful not to let the tomato sauce get on the foil as it will dissolve the foil! Bake covered for 40 minutes.</li>
<li>Uncover and top cooked shells with the rest of the mozzarella cheese. Cook another 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Let cool 5 minutes then serve!</li>
<li>I've also made this by adding a half pound of hot sausage (or ground beef or even pepperoni) to the sauce. But, the vegetarian version is remarkable. The only really fattening part is the butter/margarine. I don't like using olive oil as it has a distinctly different taste than the more pungent flavor of butter/margarine. Feel free to use either parmesan or romano cheese. Pecorino romano is by far the best to use if you can.</li>
</ol>
