<li>You can now serve immediately as a dip for tortilla chips or you can let cool and refrigerate / freeze in portions. Remember to line your moulds with clingfilm - I got distracted and forgot so it was hard to show the set but it will slice well once set if you line the moulds. To melt just reheat in the microwave, stirring every 30 seconds until hot and creamy</li>
