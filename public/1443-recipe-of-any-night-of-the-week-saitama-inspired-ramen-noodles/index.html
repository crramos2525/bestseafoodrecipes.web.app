<h5 id="instructions-to-make-saitama-inspired-ramen-noodles">Instructions to make Saitama-Inspired Ramen Noodles:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Ingredient Introduction: These are the kombu seaweed sheets and assorted fish flakes that I use. I bought them at the supermarket I work at.</li>
<li>I also bought this at work. 400 yen is cheap for 1 kg!</li>
<li>This ramen takes 2 days to complete. Let's start making it the day before you want to eat.</li>
<li>Preparations: Mix the ○ Japanese-style base together. Let it sit overnight. (Place into the fridge in summer).</li>
<li>Preparation: Wash off the blood from the pork and chicken bones in running water, and break the pork bones in half at the joint.</li>
<li>Preparation: Hold the pigs feet with a pair of tongs, burn the hairs over gas flame, and wash well with water.</li>
<li>Preparation: Roll the meat up from the thick end, and tightly tie with kitchen twine. Roll the ※ breast meat in the same manner.</li>
<li>Preparation: Wash the vegetables, and cut into approximate sizes. Caution: Do not remove the skins.</li>
<li>Make the soup: Place the pork bones into a 7~10 liter pot with lots of water, and boil over strong heat. Skim off the scum.</li>
<li>Add chicken bones, pork belly, and pigs feet once there is no more scum, and continue boiling over medium heat while continuing to remove the scum.</li>
<li>Add everything from the onions to the red peppers, boil for 2 hours, and turn off the heat.</li>
<li>Char siu: Remove the pork belly out of the soup, and boil together with the breast meat for 2 hours in the cha siu sauce. See ID: 911531 for details.</li>
<li>Making the noodle dough: Refer to, and chill in the fridge overnight. -  - <a href="https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/155377-soy-sauce-broth-ramen">https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/155377-soy-sauce-broth-ramen</a></li>
<li>Day 2 starts from this point onwards. First, turn the heat onto the soup pot.</li>
<li>Making the Soy Sauce Dressing: Set aside the amount indicated into a pot from Step 4 that was left to sit overnight in the fridge, and make the soy sauce dressing while referring to. -  - <a href="https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/155377-soy-sauce-broth-ramen">https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/155377-soy-sauce-broth-ramen</a></li>
<li>Make the soup: After bringing to a boil, leave in the pork bones, pigs feet and chicken bones, and remove the mushy vegetables from the soup.</li>
<li>Add the Japanese-style base mixture (all of the broth, konbu seaweed and shiitake mushrooms) from Step 4 into the soup, and boil over a low heat for 2 hours. The soup is now done.</li>
<li>Making the Noodles: Usingas a reference, divide the dough into 10 equal portions. Make the noodles in a pasta machine 1.7~2 mm thick, and 2 mm wide. Chill in the fridge. -  - <a href="https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/155377-soy-sauce-broth-ramen">https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/155377-soy-sauce-broth-ramen</a></li>
<li>Making the bamboo shoots: Bring water to a boil in a frying pan, quickly boil the boiled bamboo shoots in water, and strain.</li>
<li>Lightly saute the bamboo shoots and red pepper in a frying pan heated with sesame oil, add the flavoring, and saute until there are about 2 tablespoons of broth remaining. Transfer to a bowl and place into the fridge.</li>
<li>Finishing steps: Decide on the combination of soup and soy sauce dressing. Use roughly 360~400 ml of soup: 35~50 ml of soy sauce dressing. Adjust to suite your tastes.</li>
<li>Cut the well-chilled chashu into your desired thickness. Thinly cut the Japanese leek. Please refer tofor the marinated eggs. -  - <a href="https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/155377-soy-sauce-broth-ramen">https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/155377-soy-sauce-broth-ramen</a></li>
<li>Finishing Touch: Add hot water to a bowl to warm it up. Boil lots of water in a large pot, and boil the noodles for 4-5 minutes.</li>
<li>Heat the bowl while the noodles are boiling, add the soy sauce dressing, and soup while using a sieve to strain. Add the thinly sliced noodles, top with the ingredients, and it is done!</li>
<li>To put it simply, these noodles have the opposite texture of being chewy. They are more springy with a toothsome texture.</li>
<li>Extra 1: Throwing out the soy sauce and soup broth is wasteful! So, use it to make tsukudani that goes well with rice.</li>
<li>Cut the konb seaweed into thin strips, and shred the rest in a food processor.</li>
<li>Saute together with 3 tablespoons each of sake and sugar and 1 tablespoon of mirin until the broth evaporates, add 1~2 tablespoons of white sesame for the finishing touch, and it is done.</li>
<li>Place into a Tupperware container, and store in the fridge. This tastes the best mixed with rice.</li>
<li>Extra 2: If you have a dog or cat at home, mixing the vegetables (aside from the onions and leeks) with a bit of the chicken bone and meat etc. into their food will make them really happy.</li>
