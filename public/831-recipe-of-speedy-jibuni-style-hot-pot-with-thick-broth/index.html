<li>Cut the meat into bite size.</li>
<li>Rub the ◎ ingredients into the meat. Then sprinkle the katakuriko evenly on the meat.</li>
<li>Cut the Japanese leeks and skewer between the pieces of meat. Add oil to a frying pan and fry the skewers on both sides to seal in the umami flavor.</li>
<li>They'll boil in the pot later, so at this point, just cook the skewers until they're 60-70% done. You could use pork or beef instead of chicken. The skewers in the photo were made with pork shoulder.</li>
<li>Wash the taro root and microwave at 600 W for 5-6 minutes. Peel and cut in half. The size of the taro root will change cooking time so adjust for your microwave.</li>
<li>Divide the Chinese cabbage leaves from the stems. Roughly chop the leaves and cut the stems into thin strips, almost to a julienne, so they cook easily.</li>
<li>Cut the bok choy the same way as the Chinese cabbage. Julienne the carrots with a slicer or a knife. Cut the chikuwa into bite-size pieces.</li>
<li>Soak the kombu in water and make dashi stock, being careful not to let it boil. Then remove the kombu and ● ingredients for seasoning. Mix in the ▲ slurry to thicken the broth.</li>

<li>For the &quot;shime&quot; (the end of the meal), boil udon noodles, harusame noodles, soba noodles, or somen noodles in the broth. Any kind of noodles go well. I would also recommend cooking mochi cakes by dipping them in the boiling broth (&quot;shabu-shabu&quot;).</li>
<li>Of course, adding rice, eggs and green onions  to the broth is also good. Top with shredded nori seaweed sheets or crushed sesame seeds if you like.</li>
<li>If you're using any ingredients that release scum or takes a long time to cook, blanch first. Add any ingredients you like.</li>
</ol>
<p>So that&rsquo;s going to wrap it up for this special food jibuni-style hot pot with thick broth recipe. Thanks so much for your time. I am sure you can make this at home. There is gonna be interesting food at home recipes coming up. Don&rsquo;t forget to bookmark this page in your browser, and share it to your family, friends and colleague. Thank you for reading. Go on get cooking!</p>
