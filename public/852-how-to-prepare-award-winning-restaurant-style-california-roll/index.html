<p>To make California rolls, it helps to have a sushi rolling mat.

Order online from California Roll Factory on MenuPages. I'm not sure they wanted to.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="instructions-to-make-restaurant-style-california-roll">Instructions to make Restaurant-style California Roll:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Add sake and mirin to the rice when cooking, and use 1 mm less water than usual. Don't cook the rice using the 'sushi rice' setting, just use the regular program.</li>
<li>Lay the kombu on top of the rice and switch the rice cooker on!</li>
<li>Put the sushi vinegar ingredients in a small pan and bring to a simmer. Turn the heat off immediately.</li>
<li>Add the boiled sushi vinegar and water to the freshly cooked rice, leave to cool down a bit, then cover with plastic wrap to prevent from drying out.</li>
<li>Spread a piece of nori seaweed evenly with sushi rice. Slightly moisten your hands with water and flatten out the rice. Cover with plastic wrap.</li>
<li>Turn it over, wrap and all, so that the nori side is facing up. Draw a thin line in the middle with mayonnaise.</li>
<li>Top with avocado and crab sticks. If you put the avocado on the far side it may get mashed when you roll the sushi, so I think it's easier if you put the crab sticks on the far side and the avocado closer to you.</li>
<li>Fold the plastic wrap that is sticking out on the side closer to you under the mat to make it easier to roll the sushi.</li>
<li>Roll the sushi, and cut it with the wrap still on it. If you peel off the wrap with moistened hands, you won't get any sticky rice.</li>
<li>Put the masago on the cut sushi roll pieces to finish. If you don't like masago, use ground white sesame seeds instead.</li>

<li>Twist both halves with your hands and it will end up as shown in the photo. Cut into the half with the pit lengthwise again, and push out the pit.</li>
<li>Note: I cut each crab stick in half lengthwise. Adjust depending on how thick you want the crab sticks to be.</li>
</ol>
<p>When it comes to how California roll got its name, people usually have a difference in opinions. Some believe that a sushi chef who owned a small Japanese restaurant in Los Angeles coined the name.
