<h5 id="instructions-to-make-mike39s-34everybody-in-the-pool34-beef-stir-fry">Instructions to make Mike's, &quot;Everybody In The Pool!&quot; Beef Stir Fry:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Place your dethawed Sirloin or Tenderloin in the freezer for a half an hour. This will make it much easier to slice in thin strips.</li>
<li>Fill a bowl with 2 cups beef broth and all marinade seasonings except for the Cornstarch or Sesame Oil and mix together.</li>
<li>Slice beef in thin strips across the grain and place in bowl to marinate in fridge for 1 hour. Stir occasionally.</li>
<li>Place all vegetables in a large pot and fill with 1&quot; - 1 1/2&quot; of water, 1 tsp garlic powder and a little salt. Bring to a boil and turn to lower heat. Steam vegetables for 8 to 10 minutes or until brocoli looks somewhat soft. Stir occasionally. Don't over steam. You'll want a slight snap to your veggies. Drain and set to the side.</li>
<li>Mix 2 tbs cornstarch with 4 tbs water and set to the side.</li>
<li>In a large wok, pour in 3 tbs Sesame Oil and heat. Then add beef and all marinade.</li>
<li>Cook on high for 10 minutes stirring constantly bit keep lid on add much as possible.</li>
<li>If some or most of your marinade has dissipated, add 1 additional cup of your beef broth and quickly allow it to heat up.</li>
<li>You'll want to start your rice at the same time as your veggies and cook your beef last.</li>
<li>Once almost completely cooked, add half of your Cornstarch and mix it in to your marinade fast. Hopefully your marinade will be slightly thicker and will be able to adhere to your veggies when you're ready for them. You will know almost immediately. If not, add the other half of your Cornstarch mixture and stir quickly. If you find it's now too thick, add additional broth a little at a time and stir quickly. You don't want to overcook your meat. You will also want enough marinade to slightly coat your veggies as well.</li>
<li>Now add all of your steamed veggies to the Wok and stir quickly. Cook for an additional 3 minutes stirring regularly.</li>
<li>Remove from heat and serve atop rice, with soy sauce and chopsticks. If cooking with Sesame Oil, there's really no need for Sesame Seeds to garnish your dish with.</li>
<li>Since I have two super picky eaters in the house, I was unable to put baby corn, water chestnuts, bamboo or snap peas in this specific dish but you certainly can!</li>
<li>For the rice, prepare it the way the manufacture recommends. Usually, you'll rinse your rice until the water isn't cloudy then bring 1 cup of rice to 2 cups of water to a boil and turn down. Keep lid on tight for 15 minutes and do not stir. Remove from heat and let it stand with the lid on for 5 more minutes undisturbed.</li>
</ol>
<p>There is only four more sleeps until Christmas. And we hope Santa and the elves are putting the finishing touches on the naughty and nice list, but if you need to grab a couple more things or have left that big ticket item till the last minute, Tim. Deval Patrick thinks about tossing his hat into the ring, Trump plans his impeachment strategy, and the sports media are for political discussions until they aren't.
