<p>Shrimp and Grits is a classic Southern dish that's quick and easy enough for a busy weeknight meal. I was shocked when I first discovered how ridiculously easy it is to make shrimp and grits, because it's such a typical restaurant dish that I think of as really flavorful and full of pizzazz. This recipe for shrimp and grits starts with a clever tip for jump-starting the grits that I learned from Southern chef Sean Brock. In an ideal world, we'd all be getting fresh coastal shrimp for our shrimp and grits — but we'll settle for frozen shrimp with the shell on.</p>

<p>Remove the pork belly from the boiling water and give it another rinse and pat dry with paper towels. Allow the pork to cool completely or chill in fridge Mam Ruoc is Vietnamese fermented shrimp paste, a staple condiment in Southeast Asian cuisines. It can also be effectively used to disperse a crowd. Remove the pork belly from the braising liquid. Strain the liquid through a fine mesh sieve into a saucepan.</p>
