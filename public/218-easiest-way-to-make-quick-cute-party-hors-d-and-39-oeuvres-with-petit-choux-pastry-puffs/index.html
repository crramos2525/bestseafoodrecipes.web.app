<li>Sift the cake flour. Preheat the oven to 200°C (392 F).</li>
<li>Put the water, margarine and salt in a pan. Bring to a boil over medium heat, and let the liquid emulsify.</li>
<li>Turn the heat off, and add all the sifted cake flour at once while mixing rapidly with a wooden spatula. Knead the dough well with the spatula.</li>
<li>Heat the pan again while kneading the dough with the spatula. When the pastry comes together in one mass, and the pan is coated with a thin film, turn the heat off. *Don't stop mixing while the pastry is cooking!</li>
<li>Beat the eggs well, and add 1/4 of it to the pan. Mix rapidly. Add the rest of the beaten egg in 3 batches. Add the last batch a little at a time.</li>
<li>When some of the pastry dripped from the spatula forms a thick triangle shape as shown here, stop adding any more egg.</li>
<li>I had about this much beaten egg left over this time. This will be used later so keep it in reserve.</li>
<li>Fit a 1 cm round tip on a piping bag, and put the pastry in the bag.</li>
<li>Pipe out 2 cm diameter dollops of the pastry 2 cm apart on a lined baking tray. Brush with the leftover beaten egg.</li>
<li>Bake in a 200°C (392 F) oven for 15 minutes. Lower the temperature to 160°C (320 F) and bake for another 10 minutes. Leave the puffs in the oven for 5 minutes after they are baked.</li>
<li>Take them out of the oven, and leave them on the baking tray to cool. They will have puffed up to about 4 cm. When they are cool, cut them about 1/3 of the way from the top.</li>
<li>The ☆ filling: Boil the egg and shrimp. Chop the egg finely and cut the shrimp into 1cm pieces. Mix together with mayonnaise and salt and pepper.</li>
<li>The ★ filling: Cut the smoked salmon slices in half. Top each piece with 1 tablespoon of cream cheese. Fold the smoked salmon over and sprinkle with black pepper.</li>
<li>The ○ filling: Cut the cured ham into 2-3cm pieces. Cut the tomatoes into quarters. Cut the cucumber into 5mm dice. Mix them all with olive oil and herb salt.</li>
<li>The ● filling: Cut the crabsticks into 1cm pieces. Cut the avocado into 1cm dice. Combine with mayonnaise and salt and pepper.</li>
<li>Potato salad should work as a nice filling too. Try a delicious paté as a filling too, and have fun!</li>
