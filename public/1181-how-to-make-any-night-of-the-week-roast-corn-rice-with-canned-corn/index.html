<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-roast-corn-rice-with-canned-corn">The ingredients needed to make Roast Corn Rice with Canned Corn:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Prepare  bowl Plain cooked rice</li>
<li>Prepare  Canned corn, whole</li>
<li>Take  Soy sauce, mentsuyu for roast corn</li>

<li>Drain the canned corn well, and add the corn to a frying pan (don't need oil). Once the moisture has cooked off, add the soy sauce and test the flavor.</li>
<li>Add the rice, and top with aonori seaweed if you like. For seconds, mix in a bit of butter for a more western taste.</li>
<li>I worry that this might spoil in a summer bento box. Add an umeboshi when you cook it. The rice won't take on the flavor of the umeboshi, and the flavor of the umeboshi doesn't change either. It's mysterious.</li>
<li>For lunch on a hot and muggy day, I served lightly-warmed roast corn rice with salted konbu, wasabi, and cold tea. It was smooth and delicious.</li>
<li>Cook with minced ginger, sake, canned corn, the canned corn juices, soy sauce, and mentsuyu for a refreshing, delicious taste!</li>
<li>Good for onigiri and bentos. My husband used his bento box from kindergarten 43 years ago and had this for lunch. Aluminum containers get really hot!</li>
</ol>
