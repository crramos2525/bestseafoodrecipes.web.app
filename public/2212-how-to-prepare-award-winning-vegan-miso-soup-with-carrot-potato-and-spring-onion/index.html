<h5 id="steps-to-make-vegan-miso-soup-with-carrot-potato-and-spring-onion">Steps to make Vegan Miso soup with carrot, potato and spring onion:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Peel carrot and potatoes. Cut carrot about 1/4inch thickness. Cut potatoes into the same width and size of carrot pieces.</li>
<li>Slice white part of spring onion into 3/4 inch size.(Diagonal cut) Slice green part of spring onion into 1/4inch size.</li>
<li>In a small cooking pot, pour 4 cups of water and throw in carrot. Bring it to boil and cook carrot until soft with medium heat.</li>
<li>When carrot is soft enough, add kombu stock powder(kombu-dashi) and potatoes.</li>

You won't be hungry an hour after eating it like with a lot of soups. To a large saucepan, add the vegan butter/oil and warm over a medium heat before adding the onions, celery and carrots.</p>
