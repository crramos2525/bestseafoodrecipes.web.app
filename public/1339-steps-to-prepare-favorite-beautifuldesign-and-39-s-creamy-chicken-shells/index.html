<p>Before our youngest came along, we used to eat this meal just about every month. sometimes twice a month! Sometimes I serve this meal with green beans on the side. (It may even be yummy with green beans added into the shells!? I'll have to try that sometime!) Creamy Chicken Stuffed Shells.</p>
<p>Beautifuldesign's Creamy Chicken Shells is one of the most well liked of current trending meals in the world. It is simple, it&rsquo;s fast, it tastes yummy. It is enjoyed by millions every day. Beautifuldesign's Creamy Chicken Shells is something which I&rsquo;ve loved my entire life. They are nice and they look fantastic.</p>
<p>To get started with this particular recipe, we have to prepare a few components. You can have beautifuldesign's creamy chicken shells using 8 ingredients and 5 steps. Here is how you cook it.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-beautifuldesign39s-creamy-chicken-shells">The ingredients needed to make Beautifuldesign's Creamy Chicken Shells:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Make ready 3 Boneless skinless chicken breast (cut in cubes)</li>
<li>Take 1 box Jumbo pasta shells (I used about half the box)</li>
<li>Prepare 1 can Cream of chicken soup</li>
<li>Take 1 can Cream of celery soup</li>
<li>Get 1/2 packages cream cheese</li>
<li>Take 2 cup Shredded cheese of your choice (more or less to your liking)</li>
<li>Get 3 tbsp Cooking oil of your choice</li>
<li>Get 1 Alfredo sauce (used my recipe)</li>
</ol>
<p>I made this chicken and broccoli pasta much lighter than a traditional mac and cheese by using low-fat milk and no cream, using only a small amount of butter, and using reduced fat cheddar cheese. A creamy, cheesy, chicken filling accentuates these Creamy Chicken Stuffed Shells. Make a double batch to freeze for another time. The filling is a luscious cream cheese, chicken, mozzarella concoction, specked with green onion and an herbed seasoning mix.</p>
