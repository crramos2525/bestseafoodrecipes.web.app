<ol>

<li>After about 20 minutes, the surface should be lightly browned. Remove it from the oven, take out the parchment paper, and place the loaf on a cooling rack. Once it cools down, slice into 5 mm thick pieces.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 160℃. Line the pieces on the baking tray and bake at 160℃ for 10 minutes. Turn them over and bake another 10 minutes.</li>
