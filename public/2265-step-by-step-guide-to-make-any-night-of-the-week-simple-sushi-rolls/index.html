<p>Hello everybody, it&rsquo;s me again, Dan, welcome to my recipe site. Today, we&rsquo;re going to make a special dish, simple sushi rolls. It is one of my favorites food recipes. This time, I&rsquo;m gonna make it a bit tasty. This is gonna smell and look delicious.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-simple-sushi-rolls">The ingredients needed to make Simple Sushi Rolls:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Prepare 1 each salmon fillet</li>
<li>Get 1 packages nori seaweed wraps</li>
<li>Take 1 packages cream cheese</li>
<li>Get 1 wasabi paste</li>
<li>Make ready 1 1/3 cup sushi rice prepared</li>
<li>Prepare 4 tbsp rice vinegar</li>
<li>Make ready 1/2 tbsp sugar</li>
<li>Make ready 1/2 tbsp salt</li>
<li>Get 1 1/3 cup water</li>
</ol>
<p>Remove the mat and roll tightly in cling film before a grown-up cuts the sushi into thick slices, then unravel the cling film. But holy yum, these simple rolls have totally satisfied our sushi cravings during these weeks of staying at home. And now that we have our assembly-line routine down, the two of us have found that we can. I'm really starting to love sushi rolls.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="steps-to-make-simple-sushi-rolls">Steps to make Simple Sushi Rolls:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Prepare rice.   Rince rice well in strainer until water runs clear. Boil rice on medium for 5 minutes. Keep covered and DO NOT stir. Reduce to simmer for 10 minutes</li>
<li>While rice is cooking, heat rice vinegar, sugar and salt until sugar and salt are dissolved. Set aside and let cool.</li>
<li>Once rice is done simmering, transfer to a bowl and slowly add vinegar mix while stirring rice to ensure even distribution. Now let rice cool to room temperature.</li>
<li>I like the inside out style rolls, so break nori sheet in half and make sure your bamboo rolling sheet is covered in plastic wrap. With wet hands (to avoid rice sticking to you)take a good handful of rice and press evenly to all edges of nori sheet. Then flip nori sheet so rice is now on bottom and you have a clean sheet to add fillings.</li>
<li>I like to put a very thin spread of wasabi paste to start. Cut slices out of cream cheese block and line up evenly in the middle of nori sheet the length of sheet.</li>
<li>Thinly slice salmon or fish of choice (tuna and crab work very well too). Add next to cream cheese. At this time you can add other items like avocado, cucumber&hellip;&hellip;</li>
<li>Slowly and gently roll your masterpiece and be sure to add enough pressure so rice will cause sushi roll to stick in it's shape.</li>
<li>I refrigerate them for a half hour or so before I cut into about 6 pieces. Be sure to use a wet knife as the cream cheese will start sticking to a dry blade causing a mess.</li>
<li>You can then add sesame seeds and Sriracha for some added flavor and texture. This is about as basic as it gets. It sounds like a lot of steps but after a time or two it's nothing to get some fresh rolls at home.</li>
</ol>
<p>Making your own doesn't have to really be that complicated. I don't eat the raw fish variety, but I do love the veggie rolls, tempura and all the asian flavors.
