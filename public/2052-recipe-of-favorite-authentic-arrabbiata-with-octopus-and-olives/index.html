<p>Add an authentic Italian taste to your favourite pasta dish with this delicious and slightly spicy sauce. The lean shape of Penne Rigate is ideal to taste the rich Arrabbiata sauce in all its spicy flavour, but don't be afraid to try it in any pasta dish where you want. Arrabbiata Sauce (sugo all'arrabbiata): This angry (spicy) Italian sauce is simple and elegant. I love the fresh flavors mixed in with it-the fresh parsley, basil and parmesan.</p>

<h5 id="steps-to-make-authentic-arrabbiata-with-octopus-and-olives">Steps to make Authentic Arrabbiata with Octopus and Olives:</h5>
<ol>
<li>If you use normal dried tomatoes (notsoak the dried tomatoes in hot water to soften for 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
<li>After the dried tomatoes are softened cut roughly. If they are small ones you don't need to cut them.</li>
<li>Add A ingredients into a 16 to 18-cm thick-bottomed pot. Cook over a low heat. You can use a frying pan. Look at Step 12 and 13.</li>
<li>When the garlic is fragrant add B ingredients. Continue to cook until the garlic is golden brown and other ingredients infuse the oil.</li>
<li>When the garlic is golden brown add the onion and fry.</li>
<li>Fry the onion slowly for 5 minutes and stir all the way through to enhance the sweetness of the onion.</li>
<li>After 5 minutes add the cooked octopus and stir altogether.</li>
<li>Add C ingredients into Step 7. Bring to the boil and leave to stand for 30 seconds to evaporate the alcohol.</li>
<li>Add D ingredients to Step 8 and turn the heat to very low. Stir occasionally and simmer slowly for 40 to 50 minutes.</li>
<li>When some of the liquid has evaporated as in this photo, stir occasionally and continue to reduce a little further. Turn off the heat.</li>
<li>Reduce until the sauce drops off the wooden spatula when lifted. The flavour has now been deepened.</li>
<li>The cooking time differs according to the ingredient amount/ the diameter of the pan/ the heat. When you use a frying pan the sauce will be reduced faster.</li>
<li>Ideally use a pot with a little depth and cook over a low heat. You will have tender octopus in this way.</li>
<li>After the sauce is reduced at Step 10 add the dried oregano. Season with salt and pepper if necessary. Sprinkle with parsley.</li>
<li>You can eat it straight away but it is better to leave to stand for several hours. It deepens the flavour.</li>
<li>Use the sauce for pasta. When you serve it as tapas serve warm or cold.</li>
<li>[For the pasta:] Bring 3 L of water to the boil in a large pot. Add 2 tablespoons of salt (1% of salt) just before it comes to boil.</li>
<li>The cooking liquid is a factor deciding the taste of the resultant dish. Measure the amount of salt precisely.</li>
<li>Put the pasta in Step 17 and cook until al dente. Drain the pasta 30 seconds to 1 minute earlier than the package instruction says. Cook over a low heat.</li>
<li>Put 200 ml of Step 14 sauce in a frying pan for 80 g of pasta.</li>
<li>Add 50 ml of pasta cooking liquid just before the pasta is cooked. Keep the heat to very low and do not boil down the sauce.</li>
<li>Add the drained pasta to Step 21 over a low to medium heat. Mix all together.</li>
<li>Plate the pasta.  Sprinkle with parsley/ salt and pepper to your taste.</li>
<li>I used linguine in this photo but use any pasta short or long.</li>
<li>I am proud of this dish and it is seriously tasty. A great combination of octopus, black olives and spicy hot tomato sauce.</li>
<li>Is octopus and olives aglio e olio. It takes just 10 minutes to make. -  - <a href="https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/156067-basil-scented-aglio-e-olio-with-octopus-and-olives">https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/156067-basil-scented-aglio-e-olio-with-octopus-and-olives</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Those three fresh ingredients are a must for this dish! Oh, and don't forget to use a fresh parmesan, NOT the pre-shredded stuff. The word Arrabbiata means &quot;angry&quot; in Italian. Arrabbiata Sauce is a traditional Southern Italian sauce originating from the Campania region. Heat Extra virgin olive oil in a pan and add in the finely chopped garlic and chopped onion.</p>
