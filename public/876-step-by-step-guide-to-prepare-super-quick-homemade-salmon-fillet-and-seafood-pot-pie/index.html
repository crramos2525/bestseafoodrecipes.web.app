<p>Hello everybody, hope you are having an incredible day today. Today, I will show you a way to make a distinctive dish, salmon fillet and seafood pot pie. It is one of my favorites. This time, I will make it a bit unique. This will be really delicious.</p>

<p>Sockeye Salmon get their name from a Halkomelem word from the indigenous people of British Columbia. Nothing to do with either socks or eyes. Flaky bits of salmon flesh that get stuck to the pan as it cooks. Not only does it make the finished cooked fillet look like a pock-marked teenage.</p>

This is high in sodium. so it is not good for a low sodium diet! This crock pot salmon fillets with Asian style vegetables is a personal favorite. The idea comes from this Crock Pot Salmon Fillets and Green Beans I saw on A Year of Slow Cooking.</p>
