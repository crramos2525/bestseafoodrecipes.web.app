<p>Hey everyone, it is Brad, welcome to my recipe site. Today, I&rsquo;m gonna show you how to make a distinctive dish, irresistible kuwait shrimp with rice. It is one of my favorites. This time, I&rsquo;m gonna make it a bit unique. This will be really delicious.</p>
<p>Irresistible Kuwait Shrimp with Rice is one of the most popular of current trending meals in the world. It&rsquo;s simple, it is quick, it tastes yummy. It is appreciated by millions every day. Irresistible Kuwait Shrimp with Rice is something that I&rsquo;ve loved my whole life. They&rsquo;re nice and they look fantastic.</p>
<p>From quick and easy bowls and plates (like these Shrimp Fajita Bowls, Sheet Pan Shrimp and Vegetables with Rice, and Shortcut Shrimp Paella) to Cajun-inspired suppers (we love this Jambalaya with Shrimp and Andouille Sausage and this Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo), you're going to want to. Kkanpunggi tastes great on top a bed of white rice (perhaps some Kimchi on the side). Or serve it as a big communal platter with some delicious Jajangmyeon.</p>
<p>To get started with this particular recipe, we have to prepare a few components. You can cook irresistible kuwait shrimp with rice using 25 ingredients and 12 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-irresistible-kuwait-shrimp-with-rice">The ingredients needed to make Irresistible Kuwait Shrimp with Rice:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Get  Shrimp</li>
<li>Prepare 1 kg shrimps, with skin, washed, and heads cut off</li>
<li>Prepare 1/2 tablespoon turmeric</li>
<li>Get  Stuffing</li>
<li>Prepare 3 onions, chopped</li>
<li>Get 3 cloves garlic</li>
<li>Take 1 green bell peppers, chopped</li>
<li>Get 1/4 cup bunch of coriander, chopped</li>
<li>Get 4 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
<li>Make ready 1/2 teaspoon ginger, green</li>
<li>Get 1/2 teaspoon dried black lime powder, loomi</li>
<li>Make ready 1 1/2 teaspoon baharat spice</li>
<li>Prepare 1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
<li>Get 1/4 tablespoon turmeric</li>
<li>Prepare 5 saffron threads</li>
<li>Prepare 1/4 cup rosewater</li>
<li>Make ready  Rice</li>
<li>Get 3 cups rice, washed and soaked in cold water with a dash of salt</li>
<li>Prepare 1 onion, sliced</li>

<li>Get  salt to taste</li>
</ol>
<p>Give leftover cooked rice an exciting second act by turning it into this quick-and-easy Korean-style shrimp fried rice. Ordinarily whenever I cook shrimp/prawns, I use fresh raw ones I peel myself. This is one of the rare occasions when I buy already cooked and peeled prawns. Cold, cooked rice is actually a better choice here than freshly cooked.</p>

<h5 id="steps-to-make-irresistible-kuwait-shrimp-with-rice">Steps to make Irresistible Kuwait Shrimp with Rice:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Soak the saffron threads in the rosewater and set aside so the saffron releases its color.</li>
<li>To cook the shrimp, place it in a saucepan with the turmeric and some salt. Pour enough water to cover and leave to boil until shrimp is cooked.</li>
<li>Drain the shrimp and reserve the shrimp broth for later. Peel the black thread from the shrimp and leave in a strainer.</li>
<li>To prepare the stuffing: Start by crushing the garlic cloves with the ginger and green peppers, and leave aside.</li>
<li>In a medium saucepan, roast the chopped onions and the dried black lime powder until onions are tender and brown. Sprinkle some water if onions stick to the pan.</li>
<li>Add the crushed garlic mix and the rest of the stuffing ingredients:baharat, salt, cardamom powder, turmeric, vegetable oil and coriander. Mix for a few minutes before adding the shrimp to the stuffing then stir for 3 minutes.</li>
<li>Sprinkle a little bit of the rosewater-saffron mix. Cover and simmer for a few minutes, and then remove from heat.</li>
<li>To prepare the rice: In a large saucepan put the reserved shrimp-broth along with some boiled water to make a total of 6 cups of liquid. Then add in the cardamom pods, cinnamon stick, black peppers, and cloves. Bring to a boil and add salt to taste.</li>
<li>Add the rice and stir for a few seconds to prevent from sticking. Boil until rice is half-cooked, then drain and place back into the same saucepan.</li>
<li>In the meantime, fry the sliced onion in 3 tablespoons of vegetable oil then mix with the shrimp stuffing.</li>
<li>Finally, take out some rice from the middle of the saucepan leaving rice at the bottom and the sides of the saucepan. Put shrimp in the hole and cover with the rice you took out. Sprinkle the remaining rosewater-saffron water, cover and simmer for 30-45 minutes.</li>
<li>When done, remove the rice you covered the mixture with and take out the shrimps carefully and set aside, then move the rice to a serving platter and arrange the shrimps on top.</li>
</ol>
<p>Cold grains of rice have had a chance to dry out a. This garlic and spice infused dish is packed full of flavor and will become a new. Rinse the rice thoroughly with water to remove any excess starch. Heat a large pot or skillet over. Fresh shrimps are the best, although it is not mandatory.</p>
