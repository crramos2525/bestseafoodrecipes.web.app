<p>I tend to favor the fresh fish over the canned….but if time is short this recipe totally is just as great with an equal amount of canned (and very well drained) salmon. Combine mayonnaise, chili sauce and relish in a small dish. Scrumptious Salmon Cakes Haiku: &quot;Close as I could get, had to make some little swaps, still they were quite good.&quot; Subbed a couple tsp. of dry parsley for fresh, and lite Duke's mayonnaise for Miracle Whip, otherwise, did every other ingredient as directed. I combine seven easy ingredients for this salmon patty recipe.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="instructions-to-make-easy-salmon-cakes">Instructions to make Easy Salmon Cakes:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Pre heat oven to 425 degrees</li>
<li>Line a baking sheet with foil and place the salmon on the baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil and roast for 15 minutes or until fish flakes easily with a fork. Cool to room temperature.</li>
<li>When the fish is cool enough to handle, flake the salmon into bite sized pieces using a fork and transfer to a large bowl. If any juices begin to collect in the bottom of the bowl, drain the fish before moving forward with the remainder of the recipe.</li>
<li>In a small bowl, stir together the mayonnaise, dijon, worcestershire sauce, egg, pepper, parsley and smoked paprika.</li>
<li>Add the mayonnaise mixture to the salmon and, carefully, fold together being careful not to break up the fish too much. Gently fold in the pork rinds or saltine crackers. (I used pork rinds for this recipe.)</li>
<li>Form the salmon mixture into 6 patties and transfer to a baking sheet lined with parchment. Chill for 15-20 minutes. (Salmon cakes can be frozen at this point. Wrap each cake tightly in plastic wrap and then foil. Unwrap and cook from frozen by following the instructions below.)</li>
<li>While the salmon cakes chill, make the sauce by combining the mayonnaise, lemon juice, lemon zest, mustard, pepper and dill in a small bowl. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.</li>
<li>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
<li>Add the salmon cakes and cook over medium heat until golden, approximately 3-4 minutes. (Longer if frozen) Turn the salmon cakes over with a spatula. Cook until golden brown, crispy and cooked through, approximately 3 minutes.</li>
<li>Transfer to a serving platter and serve immediately with lemon dill sauce and lemon wedges, if desired.</li>
