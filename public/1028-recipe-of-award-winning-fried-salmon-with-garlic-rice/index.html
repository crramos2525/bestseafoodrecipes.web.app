<p>Hey everyone, it&rsquo;s me again, Dan, welcome to my recipe site. Today, I will show you a way to prepare a special dish, fried salmon with garlic rice. It is one of my favorites. This time, I&rsquo;m gonna make it a bit unique. This is gonna smell and look delicious.</p>
<p>Fried Salmon with Garlic Rice is one of the most popular of current trending foods on earth. It&rsquo;s simple, it is fast, it tastes delicious. It&rsquo;s appreciated by millions daily. Fried Salmon with Garlic Rice is something that I&rsquo;ve loved my entire life. They&rsquo;re fine and they look wonderful.</p>
<p>This recipe is a very healthy &amp; easy one. It's helpful for people who are on a diet or lives a healthy life. We grilled up some fresh salmon the other day and had just enough leftover to toss into this fried rice dish.</p>
<p>To get started with this particular recipe, we have to first prepare a few ingredients. You can cook fried salmon with garlic rice using 13 ingredients and 10 steps. Here is how you cook it.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-fried-salmon-with-garlic-rice">The ingredients needed to make Fried Salmon with Garlic Rice:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Get  Salmon fillets (skin on or off)</li>
<li>Make ready  corn flour</li>
<li>Get  lemon pepper seasoning</li>
<li>Make ready  buttermilk</li>
<li>Prepare  Whole grain mustard</li>
<li>Get  garlic rice</li>
<li>Prepare  white wine</li>
<li>Take  uncooked rice</li>
<li>Get  whole garlic cloves</li>
<li>Get  Garlic oil</li>
<li>Get  Heavy Cream</li>
<li>Prepare  baby spinach</li>
<li>Make ready  Salt and pepper</li>
</ol>
<p>Pour the eggs into the well and cook, stirring gently, until nearly set. Can it get any better than this? Easy salmon with honey garlic sauce is one of the best salmon recipes. Garlicky, sweet, sticky with simple ingredients.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="instructions-to-make-fried-salmon-with-garlic-rice">Instructions to make Fried Salmon with Garlic Rice:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Mix mustard with buttermilk and marinate salmon for 30 mins to 1 hour.</li>
<li>Season corn flour with lemon pepper seasoning</li>
<li>After marinating, dredge salmon in corn flour mixture.</li>
<li>Shallow fry* in cast iron or dutch oven for 4 mins on presentation side then turn over and cook for an additional 2-3 mins. *shallow fry refers to the cooking procedure of frying in oil that isn't deep frying and isn't sauteeing.</li>
<li>Drain on paper towels.</li>
<li>In the meantime, while fish is marinating, saute rice in garlic oil and whole garlic cloves until toasty.</li>
<li>Add water or chicken stock just to cover and reduce to a low simmer. Put a lid on and cook for 15 mins or until water is evaporated.</li>
<li>In a saucepan, reduce heavy cream until thickened, add white wine and season with salt and pepper.</li>
<li>Add spinach until it starts to wilt. Take cooked rice and add to cream sauce and fold together.</li>
<li>Place fish on top of rice and serve. 😊</li>
</ol>
<p>Personally, I don't eat salmon skin unless the salmon is deep-fried and the salmon skin becomes crispy. For easy cooking, there is no need to. When it comes to fried rice, anything goes — leftover meat or fish, or whatever stray vegetables are lurking in your produce drawer or freezer will do. Gently fold in the reserved salmon and serve immediately. Top with remaining scallion greens and serve with hot sauce or chile-garlic sauce, if.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s going to wrap it up with this special food fried salmon with garlic rice recipe. Thank you very much for your time. I&rsquo;m confident that you can make this at home. There is gonna be interesting food in home recipes coming up. Don&rsquo;t forget to save this page in your browser, and share it to your family, friends and colleague. Thank you for reading.
