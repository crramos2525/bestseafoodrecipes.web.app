<h5 id="instructions-to-make-not-so-traditional-ramen-noodle-soup">Instructions to make Not-So-Traditional Ramen Noodle Soup:</h5>
<ol>
<li>First you need to make your broth. Now this can take a while, so wake up early the day you want to make your soup. You need to lightly fry the spring onions, chillies, onions, garlic, and tomato paste.</li>
<li>Once browned, add in your spices and coat everything with them. Add your carcass and then five litres of water on top, with the rest of your ingredients for the broth. This needs to be brought to a boil and then simmered for a minimum of five hours. Mine went for 8 and had a deeper, more intense flavour.</li>
<li>The Tea Eggs can be prepared whilst the broth is cooking. Hard boil the eggs and then simply add your spices and tea to a pot, then submerge with boiling water. Crack the shells of your eggs but do not peel them! The cracks give a shattered glass effect in the end. Place them in the boiling spice and tea mix and leave there for 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Place the eggs into a glass bowl and strain the tea mixture on top. Leave this to intensify in colour and flavour, in the fridge. Ensure to put cling film on top so no nasty fridge smells enter your delicious tea mix.</li>
<li>Place the vinegar, sugar, water, bay leaves, and peppercorns into a pan and bring to a boil. Once it is scalding hot (that means bubbles have appeared around the edges and it is beginning to bubble in the centre) pour the mixture over your peeled and cooked beetroot and let it come to room temperature. Leave this to pickle all day, until ready to serve. Note: this makes more than I used in the dish and so feel free to not use all of it. It lasts ages in the fridge, too.</li>
<li>So the only elements left are the noodles and toppings. It has been at least five hours since you put on the broth, or longer, so you are going to start your noodles. Cook them according to packet instructions.</li>
<li>Place your chicken in the broth to heat it through, you don't want to overcook it though, as it is already cooked.</li>
<li>Whilst everything is slowly cooking, prepare your toppings. Cook the green beans (you can use spring onions however, which are best raw) and lightly fry your Portobello mushrooms in sesame oil. Once these are cooked, get ready to serve.</li>
<li>Start with the noodles, a generous portion goes into the bowl. Then the chicken (you can shred this if you like) in a neat pile to one side. Pour over the delicious hot broth (strained) and then finally top with anything else. Your eggs halved and to one side, showing the lovely yolks, the beans, sweetcorn, mushrooms and beetroot all in their own space.</li>
<li>Garnish with the nori at one side, sticking out high and sprinkle lightly the sesame seeds over the eggs.</li>
<li>Enjoy your delicious meal, which you have spent all day preparing. It's a small price to pay for this truly delicious, Not-So-Traditional Ramen Noodle Soup!</li>
</ol>
<p>Put ramen noodles in thermal cup. Ramen noodles simmered with vegetable broth, soy sauce, chili oil, ginger and sesame oil. My boyfriend loves this soup, and it's so easy to make! I usually double this recipe and add some I've been augmenting Ramen Noodle Soup for years. Try poaching eggs on top&ndash;just til the whites are set.</p>
<p>So that is going to wrap this up for this special food not-so-traditional ramen noodle soup recipe. Thank you very much for your time. I am sure that you will make this at home. There&rsquo;s gonna be interesting food in home recipes coming up. Remember to save this page in your browser, and share it to your loved ones, colleague and friends. Thanks again for reading.
