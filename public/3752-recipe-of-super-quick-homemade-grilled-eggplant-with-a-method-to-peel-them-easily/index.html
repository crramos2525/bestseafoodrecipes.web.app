<p>Hello everybody, it&rsquo;s me again, Dan, welcome to my recipe page. Today, I&rsquo;m gonna show you how to prepare a distinctive dish, grilled eggplant with a method to peel them easily. One of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I will make it a bit tasty. This will be really delicious.</p>
<p>Great recipe for Grilled Eggplant With a Method to Peel Them Easily. After trying several methods, this was the easiest way to peel the eggplants. Peel the skin off starting from.</p>
<p>Grilled Eggplant With a Method to Peel Them Easily is one of the most popular of current trending foods on earth. It&rsquo;s appreciated by millions every day. It is easy, it&rsquo;s quick, it tastes yummy. They are nice and they look fantastic. Grilled Eggplant With a Method to Peel Them Easily is something that I&rsquo;ve loved my whole life.</p>
<p>To begin with this particular recipe, we must prepare a few ingredients. You can have grilled eggplant with a method to peel them easily using 4 ingredients and 7 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-grilled-eggplant-with-a-method-to-peel-them-easily">The ingredients needed to make Grilled Eggplant With a Method to Peel Them Easily:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Make ready 3 to 4 Eggplants (small Japanese type)</li>
<li>Make ready  Serve with</li>
<li>Make ready 1 Soy sauce</li>
<li>Make ready 1 Bonito flakes, grated ginger, ground sesame seeds etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>When the weather is warm, set aside eggplant parmesan and opt for the barbecue instead of the oven! Grilling your veggies with steaks or honey mustard chicken already on the grill is not only convenient, but healthy (and super yummy)! Your barbecue can easily do double duty when you grill everything together! Turn the gas grill to low and leave on the grill until you have finished eating; if you use a charcoal grill, place them on the grate, cover the grill, and let the eggplant cook until the coals burn out. (It's even okay if you forget and leave the eggplant overnight—they will still be tender and ready to use the next morning.) The outer peel of the eggplant (the pretty purple one!) is totally edible and actually helps hold the eggplant together once it's cooked.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="instructions-to-make-grilled-eggplant-with-a-method-to-peel-them-easily">Instructions to make Grilled Eggplant With a Method to Peel Them Easily:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Cut the stem ends off. They look better if you leave the calyxes on, but I take 'em off! The prickly parts can hurt you, and it's easier to eat the eggplants with the tops off.</li>
<li>Score the surface of the eggplants lengthwise 4 to 5 times.</li>
<li>Grill the eggplants until they are charred and pitch black on the surface. (This is important!) They are done if they are completely limp when you press on them with chopsticks!</li>
<li>I grilled them in our toaster oven on medium heat for 22 minutes. If your grill only cooked one side at a time, turn the eggplants over halfway through.</li>
<li>Peel the skin slowly starting from the stem end (the top). When you pinch up the skin to start peeling, be sure not to pinch up any of the flesh underneath! This is very important!!</li>
<li>Even if the skin breaks as you peel it because you're peeling it so thinly, be sure to only pinch up the skin, not the eggplant flesh! Here's a photo of 3 completely peeled eggplants.</li>
<li>Arrange on serving plates, top with bonito flakes, soy sauce and so on, and enjoy.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you plan on turning your roasted eggplant slices into a dip like baba ganoush, you would remove the peel, but for general roasted eggplant recipes you leave the peel on. I realize that the peel of mature eggplants can be slightly bitter. Eggplant slices act like oil-slurping sponges. Even salted, gently hand-pressed slices will soak up plenty of oil. To reduce the amount of oil you'll need, try brushing olive oil onto one side of eggplant slices; then lay them oil-side down in a hot skillet without crowding (a crowded pan will cause the slices to steam rather than fry).</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s going to wrap this up with this special food grilled eggplant with a method to peel them easily recipe. Thank you very much for reading. I am sure you will make this at home.
