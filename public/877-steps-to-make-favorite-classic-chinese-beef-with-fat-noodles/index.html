<p>Hey everyone, it&rsquo;s Jim, welcome to my recipe page. Today, we&rsquo;re going to prepare a special dish, classic chinese beef with fat noodles. One of my favorites. This time, I&rsquo;m gonna make it a bit unique. This is gonna smell and look delicious.</p>
<p>Classic Chinese Beef with Fat Noodles is one of the most popular of recent trending foods in the world. It&rsquo;s easy, it&rsquo;s quick, it tastes yummy. It&rsquo;s appreciated by millions daily. Classic Chinese Beef with Fat Noodles is something which I have loved my whole life. They&rsquo;re fine and they look fantastic.</p>
<p>Here is a recipe on how to make traditional Chinese beef noodle soup. This is just as good as some of the traditional Taiwanese beef noodle soups that I. This is the stir fried noodles version of everybody's favourite Chinese Beef and Broccoli.</p>
<p>To get started with this recipe, we have to prepare a few ingredients. You can have classic chinese beef with fat noodles using 9 ingredients and 14 steps. Here is how you cook that.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-classic-chinese-beef-with-fat-noodles">The ingredients needed to make Classic Chinese Beef with Fat Noodles:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Make ready 400 grams Chinese fat noodles, 1 inch width (Typically 1 in width for traditional style.  However, you can get the folded up sheets and cut it into any width you prefer, or buy per-cut ones if no preference. ) (Make sure the noodle is NOT TOO WET!  It should be mil</li>
<li>Take 100 grams thin sliced beef (The kind used for hot pot with relatively higher fat to muscle ratio.  The fatties, the better)</li>
<li>Take 1 whole white onion, cut in wedges.</li>
<li>Prepare 100 grams (Optional) starchy (or tough) vegetable (i.e. peapods, broccoli stem, etc.)</li>
<li>Take 3 tbsp soy sauce</li>
<li>Take 1 tbsp oyster sauce or 1 tbsp of Hondashi (Japanese dried fish stock)</li>
<li>Make ready 1/2 tbsp sugar</li>
<li>Prepare 2 tbsp cooking rice wine (or any cooking alcohol you find really)</li>
<li>Make ready 1 Salt</li>
</ol>
<p>Marinate slices of lean beef steak then pan-fry with chunks of red pepper and a savoury sauce in this classic Chinese dish. Marinade sirloin steak in Chinese sauce, then serve with an omelette-like, egg noodle patty with vegetables. Chinese Noodle Recipes like Chicken Lo Mein, Classic Chow Mein and Pad See Ew are among the most popular recipes on this site, but when you try Cantonese dishes are more authentic to China than your classic favorites like Chinese Lemon Chicken, Sweet and Sour Chicken, Mongolian Beef. Beef noodle soup possibly is the most favorited Chinese style noodle soup.</p>

<h5 id="steps-to-make-classic-chinese-beef-with-fat-noodles">Steps to make Classic Chinese Beef with Fat Noodles:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Heat up a large non-stick skillet (or frying pan) under HIGH heat until it is sizzling hot.  (I like to use a skillet because the higher raised lip limit the extend of flying grease when pan-frying and stops things from falling out of the skillet.)</li>
<li>Drop in the thin sliced beef in bundles (3-4 slices) directly into the skillet.</li>
<li>Brown the meat on both sides for a good 7 second.   - Tips: 1) Give each bundle enough space apart (at least 1/2 inch apart) to prevent juice from pooling.  2) Limit movement of the meat during browning to prevent sticking.  3) Ideally, it's brown on the outside and raw on the inside. You will cook them again the noodle later.  If too cooked, it will dry up.</li>
<li>Remove the skillet from heat.</li>
<li>Extract the meat with chopsticks or tongs when the meat is properly browned on both surfaces.  Leave the rendered grease in the skillet for the next step.</li>
<li>Add the onion, the peapods, and a pinch of salt into the skillet and cook under HIGH heat until soften.  Tips:  Typically around 30 seconds.  Stir often.  I usually pop the lid on and whirl the content around instead for quicker result.  It effectively &quot;braises&quot; the veggies along with frying.</li>
<li>Add the noodles into the skillet.</li>
<li>There should still be a layer of grease remains on the skillet.  If so, stir it around until the noodle start to loosen up.  If not a lot of grease, let it sit on the skillet for a bit before stirring.  (If your non-stick surface is good, you shouldn't have any sticking.)  Let all sides of the noodle cook for a bit until the skillet is dried of grease or moisture.</li>
<li>Add the beef back to the skillet</li>
<li>Add the soy sauce, cook wine, sugar, oyster sauce (or Hondashi)</li>
<li>Stir until the sauce is evenly distributed.  In the case that you do have some sticking on your skillet, scrap the bottom with a spatula.  (The cooking wine should be able to remove any sticking bits.  Those are favor packets, courtesy of your sticky skillet.)</li>
