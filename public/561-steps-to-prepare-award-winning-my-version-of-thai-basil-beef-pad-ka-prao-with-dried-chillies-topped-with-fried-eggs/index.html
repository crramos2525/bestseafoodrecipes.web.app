<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-my-version-of-thai-basil-beef-pad-ka-prao-with-dried-chillies-topped-with-fried-eggs">The ingredients needed to make My version of Thai Basil Beef (Pad Ka Prao) with dried chillies, topped with fried eggs:</h5>

<p>For a truly classic way to serve this dish, pour it over rice and top with a fried egg! When my husband and I lived in St. Louis, there was a Thai food restaurant that we frequented that was unlike any other; I'm salivating The king of street food in Thailand is called Phat kaphroa, and it's made with your choice of meet (pork, chicken, beef, or seafood), stir fried with Thai. My version of this classic Thai dish has spectacular taste even with regular basil instead of Thai or holy basil.</p>

<h5 id="steps-to-make-my-version-of-thai-basil-beef-pad-ka-prao-with-dried-chillies-topped-with-fried-eggs">Steps to make My version of Thai Basil Beef (Pad Ka Prao) with dried chillies, topped with fried eggs:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Heat oil in a pan over medium heat. - Add garlic + large dried chillies + small dried chillies. - Fry until fragrant</li>
<li>Add beef mince, break it up the lumps. -  - When the beef is almost cooked through, season with oyster sauce + Thai seasoning sauce + sugar + sweet soy sauce + soy sauce. -  - Keep frying over medium heat until it's dry-ish.</li>
<li>Add basil leaves. Turn off heat. Stir to mix.</li>
<li>In a small pan or pot, add oil up to about 1 cm height. - Heat over high heat until oil is hot. - Add one egg. - Let the egg white cook until it's crispy.</li>
<li>When the egg white is crispy enough, gently scoop up the hot oil over the top of the egg to evenly cook the egg whites, and creates a thin coating over the egg yolk. -  - Remove from pan. -  - Repeat with the second egg.</li>
<li>Mix together fresh chillies + fish sauce. -  - Serve everything together with steamed rice.</li>
</ol>
<p>The sauce actually acts like a glaze as the chicken mixture cooks over high heat. The recipe works best if you chop or grind your own chicken and have all ingredients prepped before you start. Pad Kra Pao means stir-fry basil, thus making it the main ingredient in this classic dish from Thailand. The combination of Thai basil, spicy chillies, pungent fish sauce and chicken make this dish amazingly delicious and appetizing. Serve with hot rice topped with a fried egg.</p>
