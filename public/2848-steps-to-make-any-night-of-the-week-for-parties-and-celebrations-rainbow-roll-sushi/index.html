<ol>
<li>Make a basic California roll. I used tuna with mayonnaise instead of imitation crab with mayonnaise.</li>
<li>Basic California Rolls -. Attention: This recipe is for making 8 rolls.</li>
<li>Once you've made the California rolls, let them rest (over 10 minutes).</li>
<li>Prepare the ingredients that will wrap the California roll. Slice the ingredients as thin and long as you can. It will be easier to roll and also look prettier. Getting a block of sashimi and cutting it yourself is easier.</li>
<li>Slice the avocado very thinly. To avoid browning, and to add flavor, sprinkle with lemon juice.</li>
<li>Place some plastic wrap onto a sushi mat. Arrange the ingredients diagonally on the wrap, starting with avocado → tuna → avocado → salmon in that order.</li>
<li>As seen in the left picture, I used 3 pieces of tuna and 2 pieces of salmon this time.</li>
<li>Carefully remove the plastic wrap from the California roll. Place the California roll at the center of the outer ingredients.</li>
<li>Roll the two together. Imagine lifting the side closer to you upwards as you roll it away from you.</li>
<li>Be careful not to wrap the plastic wrap into the roll. Press and shape the roll over the sushi mat.</li>
<li>Remove the sushi mat. Leave the plastic wrap on and let the roll settle for a while.</li>
<li>The reason why you arrange the ingredients diagonally in Step 6 is because if you cut the roll you'd get more ingredients in every piece. Plus it'll look more pretty and fun.</li>
<li>Cut the roll over the plastic wrap. Hold the roll with your left hand (if you are right-handed). Make the first cut firmly and diagonally into the roll.</li>
<li>If you hesitate here, the cutting edge will get squashed. Once you've made a slit, concentrate on pushing the knife forward to make a clean cut.</li>
<li>Since it's a Rainbow roll, arrange the pieces in a rainbow-shaped arch. Top with flying fish roe and mayonnaise if you'd like.</li>
<li>It's also good if you arrange them diagonally so all the ingredients show.</li>
</ol>
<p>The name of this sushi variety refers to the alternating colors of fish and avocado which are reminiscent of a rainbow.
