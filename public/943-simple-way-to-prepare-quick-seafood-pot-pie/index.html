<p>This Seafood Pot Pie is filled with a smoky seafood chowder, and topped with golden, flaky puff pastry. This recipe is sponsored by Wewalka. A really good seafood pot pie is one of the most memorable dinner pies you can create. We begin with steamed mussels, in part for the meats but also for the lovely broth.</p>

<h5 id="instructions-to-make-seafood-pot-pie">Instructions to make Seafood pot pie:</h5>
<ol>
<li>To a large skillet with a little oil or a greased with some cooking spray, drop your veggies and sauté until they are soft.</li>
<li>Sprinkle salt to taste and then add your mixed seafood. Move it around the pan until everything is well cooked.</li>
<li>Now sprinkle the flour and mix well until everything in the pan is slightly coated with flour.</li>
<li>Add the milk to it to create your white sauce.</li>
<li>Now add the chicken stock to it. Lower the heat and allow the sauce to thicken.</li>
<li>While the sauce is thickening, add the cream cheese to make it creamy. Mix well. Let it cook for another 2 minutes and remove from heat. If the mixture has become too thick then loosen it up with a little extra stock. Keep aside.</li>
<li>Scoop the mixture into individual ramekins almost all the way full.</li>
<li>Now for the crust, mix together all the dry ingredients and pour in the milk. Mix really well.</li>
<li>Now add the melted butter and mix some more making sure that there are no clumps.</li>
<li>Spoon this mixture into the almost full ramekins evenly.</li>
<li>Bake at 425 for 30 minutes or until the crust has turned golden.</li>
<li>Remove and dig in immediately. A scorched tongue is but only a small sacrifice in front of this creamy divinity,</li>
</ol>
<p>Next we'll simmer shrimp in that. Not sure it gets more New England than a seafood pot pie filled with sweet and tender shrimp and scallops. Place pastry in baking dish over hot seafood mixture. Roll outer edges of pastry over edges of baking dish, and press onto edges. Creamy, hearty and perfect for cold night in.</p>
