<p>Hello everybody, I hope you are having an incredible day today. Today, we&rsquo;re going to make a special dish, seafood paella. It is one of my favorites. This time, I will make it a little bit unique. This is gonna smell and look delicious.</p>
<p>Seafood Paella is one of the most favored of current trending foods on earth. It is easy, it&rsquo;s fast, it tastes delicious. It&rsquo;s appreciated by millions every day. Seafood Paella is something which I have loved my entire life. They are nice and they look fantastic.</p>
<p>Heat the oil in a large paella pan or an extra-large frying pan. This seafood-lover's version of paella from Food &amp; Wine 's Kay Chun has four different types of shellfish, as well as plenty of meaty bites of chorizo. Seafood Paella is the most popular of the Paellas.</p>
<p>To begin with this recipe, we have to prepare a few ingredients. You can have seafood paella using 20 ingredients and 11 steps. Here is how you cook it.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-seafood-paella">The ingredients needed to make Seafood Paella:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Prepare  chicken stock or 1 stock cube with 2 cups of boiling water</li>
<li>Take  dry white wine</li>
<li>Prepare  smoked paprika</li>
<li>Take  saffron threads, crumbled</li>

<li>Get  chopped parsley, for garnish</li>

<p>With flavors of citrus and sherry, if you want just skip the seafood and eat the rice! If compliments were worth money, I'd be a millionaire! This seafood paella recipe requires organization and slicing and dicing in advance. But once the paella gets going, the process is pretty seamless—and the rewards are huge.</p>

<h5 id="steps-to-make-seafood-paella">Steps to make Seafood Paella:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Prep all ingredients before your guests arrive. Assemble them next to the braai until you are ready.</li>
<li>In a jug, mix together the wine and stock. Add the saffron and salt. Let the flavours marry for as long as possible.</li>
<li>When the braai is ready, place a big paella pan on the grid. Heat the olive oil in that pan. Add the onion and red pepper and cook it until the onion is translucent. Stir in the garlic and chorizo and cook until fragrant.</li>
<li>Add the rice. Cook, stirring for 5 minutes until the rice is toasted and coated in the oil, onion and pepper mix.</li>
<li>Stir in the stock, tomatoes, peas and paprika. Taste for seasoning and add more salt, if necessary.</li>
<li>Spread the rice evenly over the bottom of the pan. Cover the pan with foil and simmer the rice without stirring for 15 minutes, or until the rice absorbs most of the liquid. It's important not to stir the rice, even though you may want to. You want to create a crust at the bottom. If it starts to look too dry, add some water/wine, but not too much and DON'T stir.</li>
<li>Add the seafood, nestle it nicely into the rice. Cover with foil and let the seafood and rice cook. This should take about 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Remove the foil, check that the liquid is absorbed, that everything is cooked and adjust the seasoning, if necessary.</li>
<li>Finally, check to see if the elusive 'socarrat' was created. This is the golden brown crust at the bottom of the pan. If you can, wait to see if you can create the crust, if not - better luck next time&hellip;</li>
<li>Sprinkle with parsley and bring the whole pan to the table. Serve with lemons, chilli, more parsley and a lot more wine.</li>
