<p>In this video, I will be talking about my favorite Japanese potato chip brand, Calbee, and their product, Jagariko: okonomiyaki flavor. Okonomiyaki - Japanese savoury pancake containing loads of shredded cabbage topped with egg Okonomiyaki is the famous Japanese savory pancake that is usually cooked at the dining table so Kewpie mayonnaise is different from Western style mayonnaise and I like Kewpie flavor better simply. This Japanese pancake is full of authentic flavours and textures, with fresh squid or prawns and a mirin and a honey sauce.</p>
<p>Okonomiyaki ～ Japanese flavor is one of the most favored of recent trending meals on earth. It is appreciated by millions daily. It is easy, it&rsquo;s fast, it tastes delicious. Okonomiyaki ～ Japanese flavor is something that I have loved my entire life. They are fine and they look fantastic.</p>
<p>To get started with this recipe, we have to prepare a few components. You can cook okonomiyaki ～ japanese flavor using 22 ingredients and 8 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-okonomiyaki--japanese-flavor">The ingredients needed to make Okonomiyaki ～ Japanese flavor:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Make ready  Okonomiyaki Batter</li>
<li>Get 200 g all-purpose flour</li>
<li>Make ready 1 tablespoon corn flour</li>
<li>Take 1/2 tsp salt</li>
<li>Take 1 tsp bonito powder</li>
<li>Get 300 cc water</li>
<li>Take  Ingredient Ⅱ</li>
<li>Prepare 750 g chopped cabbage</li>
<li>Prepare 3 eggs</li>
<li>Prepare 1/2 cup chopped green onions</li>
<li>Make ready 1/2 cup shred onions</li>
<li>Make ready 1/4 cup shred carrot</li>

</ol>
<p>For example: Sushi, Tempura, Udon, curry rice, Yakitori, Okonomiyaki, Tonkastu and etc. I serve it with Okonomiyaki sauce (brown sauce) and Japanese Mayo (it's like american mayo without sugar so you can substitute regular mayo no problem) You can also add some finely chopped up leek which really adds to the traditional flavor. I serve it with Okonomiyaki sauce (brown sauce) and. There are many Okonomiyaki-ya, or Japanese restaurants that serve this delicious pancake, where you can even make your own with tables that have built in grill Okonomiyaki is always topped with sauces and other garnish, and the flavour comes as much from what you add to the batter, as these.</p>
