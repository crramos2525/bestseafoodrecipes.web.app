<h5 id="steps-to-make-deconstructed-34no-bake34-broccoli-tuna-and-barley-lasagna">Steps to make Deconstructed, &quot;No-bake&quot; broccoli, tuna, and barley lasagna:</h5>
<ol>
<li>First, boil the lasagna. Here I suggest to boil it in the milk if you to have enough milk and want it creamy, if not just follow your usual method for spaghetti or other pasta. Try to not get them sticking to each other by stirring it once in a while and adding it in crisscross position. No worries if some of them stick to each other though. Prepare a wide surface. Cut your broccoli while waiting.</li>
<li>After lasagna is ready, take one by one with tongs and put them separately on the kitchen sheets. Don't throw the liquid out if you boiled it on milk.</li>
<li>Boil in low heat. If you haven't soaked your barley, it's time to put your barley inside the mixture and boil for about 15 minutes. If you have, you can just add your barley inside the milk and go straight into the next step.</li>
<li>Add chopped broccoli into you sauce. Add instant cheese sauce mixes (a bit of cheating here). If you don't have an instant sauce mix, I will mix 30g of parmesan, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and corn starch (or other flour for thickening the sauce) here. Keep stirring once in a while.</li>
<li>Add tuna after your sauce has been boiling. Wait for 5 more minutes.</li>
<li>Prepare your container. It's better to do this when your cheese sauce is still hot from the stove. Layer lasagna sheet, the sauce, then lasagna sheet again, etc. until your container is full and you finish both your lasagne and your sauce. Let them sit for 15 minutes at the least. Enjoy.</li>

<p>Low Carb, low sugar, high fat Peanut Butter Bars make a perfectly delicious keto dessert or fat bomb and they taste just like Reese's peanut butter cups!

I reduced the amount of quick oats and crisp rice cereal and added in some cocoa powder. These bars ended up turning out better than I expected!
