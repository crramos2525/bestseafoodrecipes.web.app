<li>Let the egg cook for a few minutes. Do not move the egg, the whites will slowly begin to set. In the meantime, in a small bowl scoop some rice. Mould the rice and transfer to a serving bowl and set aside. Add some of the stir fried beef with holy basil onto the serving bowl. Go back to check the eggs.</li>
<li>When the whites are set and the yolk is cooked to your preference (I like my yolk runny). Remove from the pan immediately and place over the rice. Tip: if you prefer your yolk a bit more cooked, once egg is crispy on the edges flip it over gently. Cook the other side for a minute and turn off heat.</li>
<li>Its ready to serve. Eat immediately while hot. Serve with one or two lime wedges (squeeze lime over the dish before eating).</li>
</ol>
<p>Quickly turn it over a few times to mix the leaves with the meat and then remove from the heat and serve hot with rice. The key ingredient here is Thai holy basil (krapow) which has a wonderful vibrant, sweet and flavoursome aroma. You could use a little combination of mint and basil if you can't get your hands on itm but. An easy and fast recipe for vegetarian Thai basil tofu stir fry aka Tofu Pad Krapow.
