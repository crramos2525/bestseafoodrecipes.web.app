<p>The nutty aroma of the buckwheat, the perfect chewiness of the noodles, the way they slip perfectly around a chopstick — fresh soba needs little more than some dashi and a splash of soy. Soba, or buckwheat noodles, have been a classic Japanese food for centuries. Kake soba is a simple soba featuring hot noodles in a broth, sometimes seasoned with green onions. This hot soba is a perfect match for cold wintery weather.</p>

<ol>
<li>Cook the cha-soba noodles. Boil a pot full of water and cook the noodles for a little shorter than the suggested time. If the directions say to boil it for 5 minutes, about 3 minutes should be fine.</li>
<li>Drain in a colander, and rinse with cold running water. If you can, tighten up the noodles with ice water and drain well so they don't soften too quickly.</li>
<li>Make the usuyaki tamago (thin and flat omelette) and cool it down.</li>
<li>Heat the oil in a skillet, sauté the beef and add the seasoning and 40 ml of water. Simmer until shiny (about 15 minutes).</li>
<li>You can preseason the beef to your preference as well.</li>
<li>Shred the egg.</li>
<li>Thinly slice the lemon.  Grate the daikon radish and drain the excess liquid, and chop the green onion finely.</li>
<li>Warm up the sauce.  If you are using regular mentsuyu, add about 30 ml of mirin and simmer it for a while (so the sauce will be a little sweeter.)</li>
<li>Heat an electric griddle or a skillet, coat it with 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil (not listed), and sauté the cha-soba noodles lightly.</li>
<li>Spread the noodles in the skillet, top it with the shredded egg, beef topping, nori seaweed, lemon, grated daikon, and the scallion in that order. Sprinkle some ichimi red chili pepper if desired.</li>
<li>Wait until the noodles start to scorch a little, about 4 minutes over low heat. It's better to have a crunchy part and a soft part.</li>
<li>Put a lemon slice and grated daikon into the individual bowl with the sauce already in it.  Wrap the noodles with a piece of nori seaweed and it is perfect!</li>
<li>The secret to its deliciousness is the harmony of the condiments. Prepare all the toppings if possible.</li>
<li>Grocery stores near our house have been carrying a &quot;Kawara soba set&quot; as of late. It comes with dipping sauce as well, so it's very convenient! The precooked noodles are pretty good, too.</li>
<li>&quot;vegecat-san&quot; made a canned tuna version recipe.  Give it a try!</li>
<li>It's so tasty, I wouldn't be surprised if it became the official dish of an eating competition. &quot;Nanakobu-san&quot;'s recommendation is to serve it individually beforehand.</li>
<li>This is my friend K's idea. She used an actual leftover roof tile! It has some uneven parts, but it is esthetically nice!</li>
</ol>
<p>And as there are plenty of vegetables and mushrooms in. Further enjoy kawara soba with the added toppings of sliced omelette, beef, dried seaweed and other ingredients. This is an unusual noodle dish in which cha soba is fried on a heated tile and then dipped into a warm sauce before eaten. The aroma of the tea adds to the flavor of the fried noodles. Thus the reason for sharing my simple recipe for this flavorful soup only days away from the new year.</p>
