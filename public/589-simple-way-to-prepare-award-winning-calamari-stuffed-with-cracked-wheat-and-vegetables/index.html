<h5 id="instructions-to-make-calamari-stuffed-with-cracked-wheat-and-vegetables">Instructions to make Calamari stuffed with cracked wheat and vegetables:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Leave the calamari in the fridge overnight to defrost (if they are frozen), wash them thoroughly, remove the tentacles, the cuttlebone (which is like plastic) and place them for a while in a little salted water.</li>
<li>Rinse and soak the cracked wheat in cold water for 10-15' then strain it.</li>
<li>Finely chop all the vegetables. If you like, finely chop the tentacles as well (I place them at one edge of the baking tray with the stuffed calamari and then give them to my cat who just loves them!).</li>
<li>Place 2 tbsp of olive oil in a pan and sauté the carrots first, then the garlic, the fennel bulb and the rest of the ingredients together (as well as the tentacles), stir for a while and then stir in the ouzo, add the cracked wheat, the zest and lemon juice, the parsley, the spice and mix.</li>
<li>Set it aside to cool for a while.</li>
<li>Place 2 tbsp of olive oil in a baking tray with a lid.</li>
<li>Dry the calamari and stuff them with the mixture (pack it in tightly, cracked wheat doesn't get fluffy like rice does). If there is any filling left, add it to the baking tray. Pour the remaining 4 tbsp of olive oil over the stuffed calamari and bake at 180°C (no fan) covered for 30' and without the lid for and additional 15'.</li>
<li>They let out a lot of liquids, it is best to pour it over them when you take the lid off (so that they don't get too firm). You can remove that liquid in the end and make a soup.</li>
<li>I mix it with a little yoghurt and serve it as a first course (it is about half a portion per person).</li>
</ol>
<p>Cracked wheat mixed with parsley, scallion and tomatoes, tossed with olive oil, red vinegar, and lemon juice. Place cracked wheat into a bowl, pour over boiling water. Add remaining ingredients to cracked wheat and mix well. Spoon mixture into a lightly greased casserole dish. The cracked wheat looked like a whole wheat version of the bulgur as it had flakes of brown bran still clinging to the bits of wheat, while the Because tabbouleh is made with lots of raw vegetables, it's sometimes a little hard to nail down an exact recipe.</p>
