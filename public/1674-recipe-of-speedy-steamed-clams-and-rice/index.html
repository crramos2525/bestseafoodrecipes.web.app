<p>Steamed Clams With Ginger And Rice Wine is one of my favorite seafood dishes. A simple dish that is yummy on it's own or eaten with some steamed rice. Here's a quick and simple recipe for delicious steamed clams with rice wine, ginger and chilli.</p>
<p>Steamed Clams and Rice is one of the most favored of current trending meals on earth. It&rsquo;s enjoyed by millions every day. It is easy, it&rsquo;s quick, it tastes yummy. Steamed Clams and Rice is something which I&rsquo;ve loved my entire life. They&rsquo;re fine and they look wonderful.</p>
<p>To begin with this recipe, we must prepare a few components. You can have steamed clams and rice using 12 ingredients and 12 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-steamed-clams-and-rice">The ingredients needed to make Steamed Clams and Rice:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Get 350 grams Uncooked white rice</li>
<li>Get 150 grams Manila clams</li>
<li>Get 1/4 pack Shimeji mushrooms</li>
<li>Make ready 1/5 Carrot</li>
<li>Take 1/2 Thin aburaage</li>
<li>Make ready 1 tbsp Soy sauce</li>
<li>Make ready 1 tsp Mirin</li>

<p>I used rice wine instead of white wine and fish sauce instead of salt. I also added bacon fat to give the clams some extra body and flavor. Bacon fat isn't an Asian ingredient but it is a universal truth that. Here's a quick and simple recipe for delicious steamed clams with rice wine, ginger and chili.</p>

<h5 id="instructions-to-make-steamed-clams-and-rice">Instructions to make Steamed Clams and Rice:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Wash the rice and place in a strainer. Let it sit for 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Remove the sand and saltwater from the clams. Julienne the carrots and shred the shimeji mushrooms.</li>
<li>Add 25 ml of sake and 100 ml of water to a pot. Add the clams and turn on the heat. Once the shells have opened, turn off the heat.</li>
<li>Strain the boiled liquid through a strainer into a bowl. Add enough water to bring the liquid to a total of 200 ml. Add soy sauce and mirin.</li>
<li>Set aside 5-6 clams and remove the meat from the shells of the remaining clams. If they are cooked with the rice, the meat will become tough, so they will be added right after the rice has cooked.</li>
<li>Put the rice, carrot, aburaage, and shimeji mushrooms into the earthenware pot. Also pour in the liquid from Step 4. If you add 4 or 5 raw clams used for making dashi, it will taste even better.</li>

<li>After 9 minutes has passed, turn the heat to high for just 10 seconds. Place the clam meat inside and immediately cover with the lid again.</li>
<li>Wrap it up in a bath towel or something similar to retain the heat and steam for 5 minutes.</li>

<p>My name is Corrie Cooks and I am here to help! Clams are usually something you eat at your favorite restaurant or on holiday at a seaside resort, but you can also easily cook them at home, especially with the help of your Instant Pot. Steamed clams is a seafood dish consisting of clams cooked by steaming. In the United States, steamed clams are usually made with small soft-shell clams (Mya arenaria) called steamers, and sometimes with other shellfish harvested and served along the East Coast and in New England. Steamed Clams might be one of my favorite dishes to serve during the summer when the sun is out, everyone is excited to be outside and you want a light meal.</p>
