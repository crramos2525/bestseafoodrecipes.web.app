  <meta name="description" content="Shrimp and sausage jambalaya
Hello everybody, it’s me again, Dan, welcome to my recipe page. Today, I will show you a way to prepare a special dish, shrimp and sausage jambalaya. One of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I will make it a bit unique. This is gonna smell and look delicious.
While true jambalaya is really more of a thicker rice stew than a soup, it’s one of those dishes that more stock can be added to easily make it into a soup recipe.">

<p>Hello everybody, it&rsquo;s me again, Dan, welcome to my recipe page. Today, I will show you a way to prepare a special dish, shrimp and sausage jambalaya. One of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I will make it a bit unique. This is gonna smell and look delicious.</p>
<p>While true jambalaya is really more of a thicker rice stew than a soup, it's one of those dishes that more stock can be added to easily make it into a soup recipe. Try our take on this Southern classic - Shrimp and Sausage Jamabalaya recipe, made with TABASCO® Original Red Sauce. Many Cajun and Creole dishes are seasoned with the so-called holy trinity&ndash;bell pepper, onion, and celery.</p>
<p>Shrimp and sausage jambalaya is one of the most popular of recent trending meals on earth. It&rsquo;s simple, it&rsquo;s quick, it tastes yummy. It&rsquo;s appreciated by millions every day. Shrimp and sausage jambalaya is something that I have loved my entire life. They&rsquo;re nice and they look fantastic.</p>
<p>To begin with this particular recipe, we have to prepare a few components. You can cook shrimp and sausage jambalaya using 17 ingredients and 10 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.</p>

<p>To round out the menu, serve with warmed cornbread or a French baguette and a tossed green salad. Andouille sausage is a French-Creole smoked sausage made with pork and spices. If you can't find Andouille, any spicy smoked sausage, such as chorizo or. My shrimp and sausage jambalaya is warming and delicious, seasoned with spices like smoked paprika, chili powder and cumin! I like to make my jambalaya with a variety of meats: chicken thigh, jumbo shrimp, smoky sausage and even some bacon!</p>
