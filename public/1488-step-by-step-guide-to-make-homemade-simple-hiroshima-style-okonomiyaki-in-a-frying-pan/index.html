<li>(Prep) Mix the ◎ ingredients for the batter well. In the oiled, heated frying pan, spread out the batter very very thinly and cook.</li>
<li>※ When the batter is spread out, sprinkle with bonito powder. If you don't have bonito powder, dried bonito flakes or bonito soup stock is okay.</li>
<li>(Prep) Once both sides of the batter has been cooked, remove to a plate.</li>
<li>(Prep) Lastly, cook the pork.  When both sides have cooked, place uniformly onto a plate. The prep work is done.</li>
<li>Begin cooking: Keeping the heat at medium-low, break an egg into the frying pan and spread out the yolk.</li>
<li>When the surface of the egg is halfway cooked, add the noodles &ndash;&gt; pork &ndash;&gt; tempura crumbs &ndash;&gt; onion &ndash;&gt; cabbage &ndash;&gt; batter (with the bonito powder on the bottom) in order and steam a little.</li>
<li>Cover the frying pan with a plate bigger than the pan and in one&hellip;two&hellip;go! Flip it over.</li>
<li>Afterwards, spread a lot of sauce, aonori, bonito flakes and mayonnaise, and enjoy.</li>
<li>If you can't get the batter to cook well in Step 5, use a Teflon pan, heat oil, and don't touch it until it has cooked through.</li>
<li>◆Addition◆ Since the oil rendered from the pork in Step 8 has flavor, use it for cooking the egg in Step 9!</li>
<li>◆Important Addition◆ While cooking the egg in Step 9, to prevent sticking, stick your chopsticks underneath to loosen when it has cooked halfway through.</li>
<li>◆Addition◆ In Step 11, when I flipped it, the egg got stuck! Leave it flipped for a short time! The steam will naturally release the egg slowly.</li>
<li>◆Local Information◆ In Hiroshima, Okonomiyaki with noodles is pretty famous, but there's also okonomiyaki without soba, and okonomiyaki with udon. Use whatever you like.</li>
