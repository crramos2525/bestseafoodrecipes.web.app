<li>As soon as the butter start to melt, add in shallots. -  - Saute until translucent. -  - Add in garlic and saute until aromatic. -  - Add in black pepper, white pepper, sliced curry leaves, crab meat and chili.</li>
<li>Saute until the curry leaves have wilted and the mixture is well combine. -  - Add in hoisin sauce, oyster sauce, light soy sauce and honey. -  - Stir to combine well. -  - Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
<li>Prepare the cheese sauce. -  - In a sauce pot over medium heat, add in butter and flour. -  - Whisk to combine. -  - Continue whisking until the mixture is pale yellowish.</li>

<li>Deep fry and assemble the pizza. -  - Prepare a dutch oven or a deep fryer with at least 3 inches of oil. -  - <em>The ratio of canola oil to olive oil is 4:1.</em> -  - <em>If you use 1 cup of canola oil, your olive oil should be 1/4 cup.</em> -  - <em>Olive oil is bad for deep frying as it has low smoking point. It is used, in this recipe however, for flavoring.</em> -  - <em>Drop a small pinch of dough into the oil. If it starts to sizzle, the temperature of the oil is ready.</em></li>
<li>After shaping the pizza dough, gently and carefully, drop the pizza dough into the oil away from you. -  - Deep fry until bottom is golden brown. -  - Using tongs to carefully flip the pizza dough. -  - Deep fry until golden brown on the other side as well.</li>

<li>Careful as adding the curry leaves into oil will splatter.* -  - Immediately, spoon and spread the black pepper crab cheese mixture over the pizza dough. -  - Top the pizza off with small dollops of mayo. -  - *You can use a piping bag with a star tip if you wanna get fancy, or you can simply use a squeeze bottle.*</li>
<li>Next, using scissors, cut the coriander over the top. -  - Top with some of the fried curry leaves. -  - Finally, drizzle honey over the pizza in a spiral motion. -  - Repeat the steps for the remaining pizza. -  - Slice and serve immediately.</li>
