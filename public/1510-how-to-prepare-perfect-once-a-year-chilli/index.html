<h5 id="steps-to-make-once-a-year-chilli">Steps to make Once a year chilli:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Wash &amp; soak your beans over night. (if u actually use dry beans)</li>
<li>Dice veggies</li>
<li>Place everything aside from meats into a large pot. (All seasonings, herbs, spices, liquids, &amp; beans). This allows the stock/broth to soften up veggies, rice &amp; beans a little &amp; for all the flavors to marry somewhat.</li>
<li>Fry up bacon in a separate pan. (Crispy) remove from pan. Use remaining oil to brown ground meat &amp; sausages in.</li>
<li>Once it’s browned, drain any access oil from meat. (Shouldn’t be much) Add all meats to pot with everything else. Use a blender to cut crispy bacon up &amp; add to pot. If you don’t have blender, just cut it up.</li>
<li>Add 3-4 cups of water to pot. High heat for about an hour. *YOU MUST CONTINUE STARRING &amp; MIXING DURING THIS HOUR SO THAT CHILLI DOESN’T BURN !!!</li>
<li>Take away from heat &amp; let sit for another hour. Once cooled somewhat, this will allow you to taste &amp; add whatever you may feel you need more of. Turn heat to a simmer, &amp; let it ride. Turning &amp; starring here &amp; there, insuring no burning or sticking is taking place. I simmer mines for nearly 4-5 hours. Once I’m sure it’s complete, add shrimp &amp; continue simmer for another 10-20 mins. Bowl up &amp; enjoy.</li>
