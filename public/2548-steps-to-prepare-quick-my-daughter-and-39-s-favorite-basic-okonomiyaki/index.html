It is one of my favorites food recipes. This time, I&rsquo;m gonna make it a little bit unique. This is gonna smell and look delicious.</p>
<p>My Daughter's Favorite Basic Okonomiyaki is one of the most favored of current trending foods in the world. It is simple, it&rsquo;s fast, it tastes delicious. It&rsquo;s appreciated by millions daily. They are fine and they look fantastic. My Daughter's Favorite Basic Okonomiyaki is something that I have loved my entire life.</p>
<p>This week on &quot;Dear Test Kitchen,&quot; Ivan Orkin joins Josh to make two different versions of okonomiyaki, a Japanese savory pancake stuffed with, in Ivan's. Okonomiyaki - Japanese savoury pancake containing loads of shredded cabbage topped with egg, meat and bonito flakes. Okonomiyaki is the famous Japanese savory pancake that is usually cooked at the dining table so you can customize it to your taste.</p>
<p>To begin with this particular recipe, we have to prepare a few ingredients. You can have my daughter's favorite basic okonomiyaki using 10 ingredients and 8 steps. Here is how you cook it.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-my-daughter39s-favorite-basic-okonomiyaki">The ingredients needed to make My Daughter's Favorite Basic Okonomiyaki:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Take  Cabbage</li>
<li>Make ready  Plain white flour</li>
<li>Get  ＊ Egg</li>
<li>Prepare  ＊Water</li>
<li>Make ready  ＊ Grated nagaimo yam</li>
<li>Make ready  ＊Soy sauce</li>
<li>Get  ＊ Mayonnaise</li>
<li>Make ready  ＊ Bonito flakes</li>
<li>Get  ＊ Tiny dried shrimp</li>
<li>Get  The additions: Thinly sliced pork belly, squid, shrimp</li>
</ol>
<p>The batter and cabbage is the basic ingredients for Oknomiyaki and rest of other ingredients are totally up to you! Our favorite &quot;best&quot; Osaka Okonomiyaki recipe (also called Kansai style Okonomiyai) is immediately below, and further down you Recipes for Hiroshima style Okonomiyaki and a variety of other ideas on our Recipe Variations page. Okonomiyaki is one of my favorite savory pancake, hands down! 'Okonomi' means 'what you… As promised to Tom and other friends, here is a basic recipe for the (modern) Osaka/Kanasai-style Okonomiyaki (Osaka is the name of the city, Kansai means Western Japan). We will introduce okonomiyaki from Japan.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="instructions-to-make-my-daughter39s-favorite-basic-okonomiyaki">Instructions to make My Daughter's Favorite Basic Okonomiyaki:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Chop up the cabbage into 5 mm square pieces.  It's quicker to chop in a food processor, but this tends to make the cabbage too watery, so it's best to hand-chop it with a knife.</li>
<li>Mix all the ＊ ingredients together. Mayonnaise is used to add a little oil to the batter, which makes it easier to mix. The bonito flakes and tiny dried shrimp are for adding extra umami.</li>
<li>Add the flour to the mix gradually, in about 3 portions, mixing between each addition. Coat the chopped up cabbage with additional flour, besides the cupful used for the batter.</li>
<li>Just before you're going to cook the okonomiyaki (this is important!) mix the batter and cabbage together. Mix up the batter from the bottom using a large spoon about 30 times, while incorporating air into it.</li>
<li>Heat some oil in a frying pan over medium heat, and pour in about 1 and 1/2 ladles of batter in. Top with the additions of your choice, and steam-cook with a lid on both sides.</li>
<li>Don't press down on the okonomiyaki with a spatula while you're cooking it.  For the cooking oil, use some oil you previously used for tempura if you have it. It should add flavor.</li>
<li>I used an Osaka area sauce called Kinmon sauce and Japanese Worcestershire sauce in equal amounts. &quot;Carp sauce&quot; from Hiroshima is delicious too.</li>
<li>In Kansai, white rice is a must with okonomiyaki. We eat the okonomiyaki with it as a 'set meal'.  I used reduced calorie mayonnaise here.  You can add tempura batter crumbs (tankasu) to the batter if you'd like.</li>
</ol>
<p>We made the dish in the class of Department of Food Science. Sometimes we eat okonomiyaki as a snack and sometimes we eat it as a light, healthy meal. The Shizuoka version uses dried shrimp (sakura ebi), but. Okonomiyaki sauce is a Worcester-based sauce with some sweetener, and it is the crucial flavor of this dish. We like Otafuku brand, but anything you can find is fine.</p>
<p>So that is going to wrap it up with this special food my daughter's favorite basic okonomiyaki recipe. Thanks so much for your time. I am confident you will make this at home. There&rsquo;s gonna be interesting food at home recipes coming up. Don&rsquo;t forget to save this page on your browser, and share it to your family, friends and colleague. Thank you for reading.
