<h5 id="steps-to-make-mike39s-beginners-spanish-seafood-paella">Steps to make Mike's Beginners Spanish Seafood Paella:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Seafoods required.</li>
<li>Paella Pan. It's important for the even cooking of your rice.</li>
<li>When I'm making anything seafood related - I always make a basic seafood stock for later use that week. So, know that with this recipe - you'll have much more stock than you'll actually need. This recipe makes about 7 cups but you'll only need 3 cups total for this specific Paella dish.</li>
<li>Bring 8 cups water, a 1/2 cup white wine and a 1/2 tsp salt to a heavy boil. Add dethawed lobsters to boiling water [shells left on] for 1 - 1/2 minutes total. Remove lobster tails from stock with a slotted spoon immediately. Authors Note: Your lobster will be hard to pull from the shells since it's only blanched. But, no worries. You can always flake your lobster. In fact, it can go further that way.</li>
<li>Bring stock fluids back up to a steady boil. Add frozen shrimp - peels and legs still on - to boiling water. Once back up to a steady boil - remove shrimp from water with a slotted spoon immediately. Authors Note: You'll want your shrimp firm and pink with no fishy scent to them.</li>
<li>Bring water back up to a steady boil. Add frozen scallops to boiling water. Once back up to a steady boil - remove scallops from water with a slotted spoon immediately. Authors Note: If a scallop isn't white and is somewhat discolored - throw her out. She's icky!</li>
<li>Allow your blanched seafood to cool on your counter before shucking or chopping. Do not refrigerate your seafood. Your cooking time will move pretty quickly so there's no risk.</li>
<li>While waiting - chop your vegetables.</li>
<li>Also, cold rinse your frozen, presteamed mussels. There may still be some sand in them. Pull any beards that may still be attached. Refrigerate clams/mussels. Know that they can go South pretty quick if not refrigerated.</li>
<li>Soak your rice in water. Fully drain after 15 minutes in a tight mesh strainer. Otherwise you'll have a soupy Paella. Paella should always be rib sticking thick and hearty.</li>
<li>Chop / shred your lobsters, shuck your shrimp - leaving on tails and halve your jumbo scallops.</li>
<li>Soak 2 large pinches of saffron in 2 tbsp of quality white wine to soften threads for 10 minutes. You'll love the color the saffron eventually lends to the wine! It's beautiful!</li>
<li>In a large Paella pan or heavy skillet, heat 3 tbsp olive oil. At medium high heat - add your chopped hard vegetables - onions and bell peppers. Sauté for 8 minutes then add your FULLY drained rice. Fry for 3 more minutes uncovered. Stir regularly.</li>
<li>Add your minced garlic and 2 1/2 cups lobster / wine stock to pan. Reserve 1/2 cup to add if needed.</li>
<li>Add everything in the Herbs &amp; Seasonings section [except for fresh parsley] and everything else in your Vegetable section. Mix well.</li>
<li>Bring rice mixture to a boil and let the liquid reduce just slightly. Cover with a tight fitting lid or, tightly with tin foil and cook on low for 20 minutes. At 15 minutes in - add your fresh parsley and stir. Try not to peek during but, make sure she isn't burning.</li>
<li>Uncover pan and in this order - lay your blanched lobster, shrimp and scallops over the rice, pushing them into the rice just slightly. Add a little stock if needed. You'll definitely need some steam at this point. Cover tightly again and steam on low heat for another 5 minutes. At 3 minutes in - add your presteamed clams. Authors Note: If a clam doesn't open - throw it out. She's icky too!</li>
<li>A decent, affordable pre-fabed Paella Kit to consider for ease in place of the Herbs &amp; Seasonings and Rice sections. Again, use only 1/2 of that seasoning packet included and taste test from there.</li>
<li>Garnish with fresh green onions, chopped parsley and lemon wedges. Lightly drizzle with garlic infused olive oil. Serve with fresh, warm French bread and a quality white wine. Enjoy friends!</li>
