<ol>
<li>Make the patterns and molds Cut the milk cartons into 4.5cm wide strips.</li>
<li>Form the Step 1 strips into circles, and fix them with staples to make 15, 10 and 5 cm diameter circular molds.</li>
<li>Wrap the part with the staple in plastic wrap.</li>
<li>Make the base Mix 440 g of sushi rice with with the sakura denbu. Divide into two 30 g portions, one 100g  portion, and two 140 g portions.</li>
<li>Divide the remaining white uncolored rice in to one 30 g portion, two 100 g portions and one 140 g portion. Moisten the circular molds quickly with water.</li>
<li>Place the 5 cm mold in the center of a plate, fill with 30 g of pink sushi rice and press down evenly.</li>
<li>Add 30 g of white sushi rice on top of Step 6, and press down evenly. Add another 30 g layer of pink sushi rice and press down evenly. Remove the mold.</li>
<li>Place the 10 cm circular mold around the Step 7 rice.</li>
<li>Fill with 100 g of white sushi rice and press down evenly. Add 100 g of pink rice, then 100 g of white rice, pressing down evenly each time. Remove the mold.</li>
<li>Place the 15 cm mold around the Step 9 rice.</li>
<li>Add 140 g of pink rice, 140 g of white rice and 140 g of pink rice in that order, pressing down evenly each time. Remove the mold.</li>
<li>When removing the mold, hold down the edges of the sushi rice with a spoon or your hands, and lift the mold up gently from the bottom little by little.</li>
<li>Make and add the decorations. Crush the hanpen in a food processor.</li>
<li>Coat the Step 11 rice base all over with the crumbled hanpen from Step 11.</li>
<li>Cut the ham (or if using fish sausage, use a vegetable peeler to slice it) into strips, form a ribbon, and secure on top of the Step 14 cake with a short piece of pasta.</li>
<li>Wrap the smoked salmon slices to form roses. Fix on top of the cake with shiso leaves, next to the Step 15 ribbon.</li>
<li>Slice the cake Moisten your knife before slicing. The cake is quite thick, so you will need to insert your knife 4-5 times per slice. Moisten the blade each time.</li>
<li>It's difficult and time consuming to slice the cake nicely, so I recommend slicing it first and bringing it to the table already sliced.</li>
