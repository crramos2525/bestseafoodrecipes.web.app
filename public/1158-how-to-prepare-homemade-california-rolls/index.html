<p>Hey everyone, it is me again, Dan, welcome to my recipe page. Today, I will show you a way to prepare a distinctive dish, california rolls. It is one of my favorites food recipes. This time, I am going to make it a bit tasty. This will be really delicious.</p>
<p>California Rolls is one of the most favored of recent trending meals in the world. It is appreciated by millions every day. It is simple, it is fast, it tastes yummy. California Rolls is something which I&rsquo;ve loved my whole life. They are nice and they look fantastic.</p>
<p>A California roll or California maki is a makizushi sushi roll that is usually rolled inside-out, and containing cucumber, crab or imitation crab, and avocado. Most versions of California Roll include crab and avocado. Although I prefer using real crab meat, if you don't have access to fresh seafood, imitation crab (a.k.a. surimi) will do in a pinch.</p>
<p>To get started with this recipe, we have to first prepare a few ingredients. You can have california rolls using 6 ingredients and 14 steps. Here is how you cook it.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-california-rolls">The ingredients needed to make California Rolls:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Get 1 1/2 bowlful Sushi rice</li>
<li>Take 1/2 sheet Nori seaweed</li>
<li>Prepare 4 slice Avocado</li>
<li>Get 1/4 cut lengthwise Cucumber</li>
<li>Get 1 Imitation crab sticks</li>
<li>Make ready 1 Toasted sesame seeds</li>
</ol>
<p>Cover a makisu (sushi rolling mat) with plastic wrap. Place half of a sheet of the seaweed over the plastic on the mat. The origin of the California roll is highly debatable. Some say it was invented in Los Angeles, while others claim it was actually invented in Canada.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="instructions-to-make-california-rolls">Instructions to make California Rolls:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Cover your sushi mat (both sides) with plastic wrap.</li>
<li>Don't worry about wasting plastic - cover it up securely so that the sushi mat doesn't stick out from the sides or shift around. Use 2 sheets if it's not wide enough.</li>
<li>Fold the nori sheet in half to separate. Cut the crab sticks lengthwise so that the red part is evenly distributed on both pieces. Remove the pit from the avocado and cut it into 12 lengthwise wedges.</li>
<li>Remove the stem end of the cucumber, and slice it into fourths. Remove any seeds.</li>
<li>Lay a sheet of nori horizontally. Evenly spread the sushi rice. Make a mounded lip on the edge of the far-side.</li>
<li>Quickly flip over the nori and sushi rice. Make sure the lip remains on the far-side. Line the near-side of the nori and rice to the edge of your sushi mat.</li>
<li>Place 2 slices of the avocado on the center, then place the imitation crab sticks on top with the red side facing downwards. You can also use 4 slices of avocado if you'd like.</li>
<li>Roll it up from the front as you press the ingredients together. You can see in this photo that I forgot to line the rice to the edge of my sushi mat.</li>
<li>When you finish wrapping, the end of the sushi mat should meet the lip of the rice. So, press the rice of the lip slightly until any excess sticks out. This serves as a glue.</li>
<li>Remove the end of the sushi mat. Roll the sushi roll and squeeze tightly to secure the rice together. Now roll the sushi again to shape.</li>
<li>Sprinkle the roasted sesame seeds on top.</li>
<li></li>
<li>Leave it in a cool place for a while, then slice into sixths. The result will look nicer if you wipe your knife with a damp cloth between each slice.</li>
<li>Done.</li>
</ol>
