<p>I don't know what they do to it, but they make superb Yakisoba. We use Chuka Men, Chinese style noodles, in Yakisoba, but the dish is not Chinese at all. It is actually very Japanese, and nothing like Chow Mein other than they are both noodle dishes. Yakisoba is a Japanese noodle dish that literally translates to grilled (yaki) noodles (soba).</p>
