<h5 id="instructions-to-make-butter-sautéed-king-oyster-mushrooms-on-fresh-fettuccine">Instructions to make Butter Sautéed King Oyster Mushrooms on Fresh Fettuccine:</h5>
<ol>
<li>To make the pasta: Put the flour in a bowl, make a depression in the center of the flour, and drop the egg yolk into it (this is the flour I use).</li>
<li>Stir up the flour with a fork (as if whirling it like a washing machine). For more on pasta making, see my recipe for &quot;Basic Chewy Fresh Pasta&quot;.</li>
<li>Use your hand to mix evenly (do not knead. Blend evenly until no longer crumbly or floury).</li>
<li>Add the salt and olive oil, and blend it in (do not knead).</li>
<li>Put the pasta dough into a large Ziploc bag (cheaper brands tend to tear open at the sides). It should still be crumbly at this point.</li>
<li>Step on the bag with your bare feet, fold it, then repeat. Of course, if you're too rough, even a Ziploc will tear open. Start by stepping from the bottom of the bag, as if stretch it toward the opening.</li>
<li>Once the dough becomes elastic enough to the point where it springs back in place, roll it up and store it in the refrigerator for an hour. Be sure to press out the air and seal the top.</li>
<li>Attach a 7 mm tagliatelle die to your torchio (hand-crank pasta press). Before attaching the die, dampen it and remove any dried crumbs.</li>
<li>Attach the torchio to the work bench and crank out the pasta.</li>
<li>Dry out the pasta on a laundry rack (or a pasta drying rack). (To make sure the sides don't become crumbly, crank it out at an even speed.)</li>
<li>For the butter sautéed mushrooms: Slice the King Oyster mushrooms crosswise into 5 mm thick pieces. This is a good size for enjoying its texture.</li>
<li>For the sauce: Finely mince the garlic and set aside.</li>
<li>Roughly mince the Italian parsley and set aside.</li>
<li>For the butter sautéed mushrooms: Thoroughly heat an iron skillet (I use a heavy-duty 24 cm diameter.)</li>
<li>Briskly sauté the king oyster mushrooms in oil.</li>
<li>Once the mushrooms are lightly brown, season with salt and pepper.</li>
<li>Add the white wine, cook off the alcohol, then turn off the heat.</li>
<li>To make the sauce: Shift the mushrooms to the edge of the skillet, place the garlic into the center and pour olive oil over it (use the residual heat to sauté until fragrant).</li>
<li>Add the butter.</li>
<li>In a separate pot, boil the water for the pasta.</li>
<li>Boil the pasta.</li>
<li>For the sauce: Heat the skillet. Fettuccine boils quickly, so the sauce should be simmering by the time you boil the pasta.</li>
<li>Emulsify the sauce by ladling in a tablespoon of the boiled pasta water.</li>
<li>Drain the pasta. If fresh, the pasta should take only a minute. If frozen, a minute and a half. It will cook through quickly, so drain it while still firm.</li>
<li>Add the pasta to the skillet and toss together with the sauce. The texture of the pasta is key, so work quickly over high heat.</li>
<li>Add the Italian parsley and season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
<li>Transfer to individual serving dish, garnish with Italian parsley and serve.</li>
