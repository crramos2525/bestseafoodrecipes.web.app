<li>Keep the jelly in the fridge. Use within 1 -2 days.</li>
<li>Best served wih iced milk coffee.</li>

<p>Coffee jelly is a jelly dessert flavored made from black coffee and gelatin. This is an easy, no bake, coffee dessert recipe that is a showstopper! Agar agar jelly is a popular dessert in Thailand because it's so hot all the time! This latest addition to my agar jelly recipe collection is quite different because of the robust. This smooth cream cheese flan topped with a golden brown caramel is an elegant dessert that can be baked and chilled until serving.</p>
