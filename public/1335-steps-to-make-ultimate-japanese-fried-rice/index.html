<p>Hey everyone, it&rsquo;s John, welcome to my recipe page. Today, I will show you a way to prepare a distinctive dish, japanese fried rice. It is one of my favorites. This time, I&rsquo;m gonna make it a bit tasty. This is gonna smell and look delicious.</p>
<p>Japanese Fried Rice is one of the most popular of recent trending foods in the world. It is simple, it is quick, it tastes delicious. It&rsquo;s enjoyed by millions every day. They&rsquo;re nice and they look wonderful. Japanese Fried Rice is something which I&rsquo;ve loved my entire life.</p>
<p>When whipping up Japanese fried rice at home, I try to go with rice that is at least a day old (and preferably refrigerated). Long, scientific story cut super-short: it's because some evaporation. Japanese fried rice is traditionally cooked on a teppan, a flat open-top grilling surface, but you can make it just as readily in a wok or a large pan.</p>
<p>To get started with this particular recipe, we have to prepare a few components. You can cook japanese fried rice using 10 ingredients and 5 steps. Here is how you cook that.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-japanese-fried-rice">The ingredients needed to make Japanese Fried Rice:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Make ready  cooked white rice (leftover rice is fine)</li>
<li>Make ready  carrot</li>
<li>Prepare  cabbage</li>
<li>Make ready  egg</li>
<li>Get  Any kind of meat or seafood(beef, chicken, shrimp, etc)</li>
<li>Prepare  salt &amp; pepper</li>
<li>Prepare  Chinese chicken stock</li>
<li>Prepare  mayonnaise(kewpie)</li>
<li>Take  soy sauce</li>
<li>Take  seaweed</li>
</ol>
<p>I craved comfort foods like this rice dish. Japanese fried rice is called 'chāhan' (チャーハンor炒飯). It is also called 'yakimeshi' (焼飯) but I remember that the word 'yakimeshi' was used by older people and younger people called it 'chāhan'. Fried rice, a superb way to use up leftover cooked rice, is quite easy to make at home.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="instructions-to-make-japanese-fried-rice">Instructions to make Japanese Fried Rice:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Crack and beat 1 egg. Cut cabbage. Chop carrot in small pieces.</li>
<li>Heat the pan and put some oil in it. Scramble the egg in the pan and add your favorite meat or seafood. Add in the cooked rice.</li>
<li>Add Chinese chicken stock, chopped carrot, mayonnaise and fry them with wooden spatula.</li>
<li>Add cabbage. Season the rice with soy sauce, salt and pepper before turning off the heat.</li>
<li>Finish! It's a perfect meal for your busy day!</li>
</ol>
<p>Avoid using short-grain or sushi rice for this dish, which will result in a starch, clumpy dish. Japanese fried rice is often served with grilled chicken at restaurants. My favorite variant is to use leftover roasted chicken with the fried rice. I had a request to make Japanese fried rice so that is what I am going to do. I don't own a hibachi style grill like they use in the restaurants so I am just using a skillet, but the results are pretty much the same.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s going to wrap this up with this exceptional food japanese fried rice recipe. Thank you very much for your time. I am confident that you will make this at home. There is gonna be interesting food at home recipes coming up. Remember to bookmark this page in your browser, and share it to your family, friends and colleague. Thanks again for reading. Go on get cooking!</p>
