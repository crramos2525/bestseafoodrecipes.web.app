<p>These Surf and Turf Kabobs with Chimichurri might just be my summertime staple this year. Surf and turf or surf 'n' turf is a main course combining seafood and red meat. A typical seafood component would be lobster (either lobster tail or a whole lobster), prawns, shrimp, squid or scallops. gumbo filé, gumbo base, shrimp, smoked sausage, water, oil. Marinated shrimp and lightly seasoned steak are grilled together for a delightful surf-and-turf dinner for two.</p>

<li>If you are using a sausage with high fat content (such as pork), you want saute them until grease is brought out and set aside on some paper towels (underneath and on top) to drain. I use venison, which is a very lean sausage, so I skip this step.</li>
<li>In small pot, cover 8 eggs with one inch of water and bring to boil,cook for 7 minutes then place eggs in ice water bath. When cool, peel and set aside.</li>
<li>In a large Dutch oven, heat your vegetable oil on medium high. When it begins to ripple, drop a little bit of your flour onto it. If it immediately begins frying, your oil is ready. Add your flour 1/2 cup at a time and stir into oil until all has been used. Lower heat to medium low and stir continuously until roux is the color of milk chocolate. This takes time!

<li>Add the broth from your chicken and add water until it reaches 9 quarts. Raise heat to high. Your roux will not incorporate into broth until it starts to boil. Stir occasionally until this happens.</li>
<li>Add your sausage and shrimp to boiling pot. Bring to boil again, then lower heat to simmer for 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Add crab meat and eggs. Simmer for 10 more minutes.</li>
<li>While gumbo is simmering, debone the chicken, add to pot and stir gently. Take pot off of heat and let it sit for 8 minutes, covered.</li>
