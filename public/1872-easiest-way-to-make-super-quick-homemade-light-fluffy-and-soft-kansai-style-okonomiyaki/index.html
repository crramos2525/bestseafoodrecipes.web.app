<p>Hello everybody, it is John, welcome to my recipe site. Today, I will show you a way to make a special dish, light, fluffy, and soft kansai-style okonomiyaki. It is one of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I will make it a little bit tasty. This will be really delicious.</p>
<p>Light, Fluffy, and Soft Kansai-Style Okonomiyaki is one of the most popular of current trending foods on earth. It&rsquo;s appreciated by millions daily. It&rsquo;s easy, it is fast, it tastes yummy. Light, Fluffy, and Soft Kansai-Style Okonomiyaki is something that I have loved my whole life. They are fine and they look wonderful.</p>
<p>Pork / Bacon - While Osaka/Kansai-style okonomiyaki is usually topped with thin strips of pork Mix until all the dry ingredients are evenly coated (but don't overmix, we want to keep that cabbage nice and fluffy). Okonomiyaki are Japanese savoury pancakes packed with flavour and SO easy to make! Okonomiyaki - Japanese savoury pancake containing loads of shredded cabbage topped with egg You might have heard that the cooking style of okonomiyaki with the batter mixed with shredded I remember making okonomiyaki without mixing cabbage in the batter when I was little as I was born.</p>
<p>To get started with this particular recipe, we must prepare a few components. You can have light, fluffy, and soft kansai-style okonomiyaki using 10 ingredients and 8 steps. Here is how you can achieve it.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-light-fluffy-and-soft-kansai-style-okonomiyaki">The ingredients needed to make Light, Fluffy, and Soft Kansai-Style Okonomiyaki:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Take 200 grams Plain flour</li>
<li>Prepare 250 grams Japanese dashi stock</li>
<li>Get 350 grams Nagaimo yam</li>
<li>Make ready 3 Eggs</li>
<li>Make ready 1/3 Cabbage</li>
<li>Get 1 Squid</li>
<li>Make ready 200 grams Thinly sliced pork belly</li>
<li>Make ready 1 Japanese leek</li>
<li>Take 50 grams Red pickled ginger (optional)</li>
<li>Prepare 1 Tempura crumbs</li>
</ol>
<p>Okonomiyaki, sometimes called Japanese pizza or Japanese pancake, is one of the best dishes to make if you're a beginner japanese cook. This recipe is inspired by my recent trip to Osaka (see link to my Osaka vlog below), and this particular style of okonomiyaki is a dish that Osaka is known for. Okonomiyaki comes from combining two Japanese words &quot;okonomi&quot; and &quot;yaki&quot;, meaning &quot;as you like it, grilled.&quot; The ingredients vary by region. Kansai-style, the most common version, mixes ingredients into the batter before grilling.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="instructions-to-make-light-fluffy-and-soft-kansai-style-okonomiyaki">Instructions to make Light, Fluffy, and Soft Kansai-Style Okonomiyaki:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Make dashi stock (I used dried bonito, konbu and stock powder) and leave to cool. Chop the cabbage and pickled ginger. Slice the Japanese leek. After preparing the squid slice into thin batons (7 mm x 2-3 cm). Cut the tentacles into the similar sizes. Cut the pork into bite sizes or leave as they are.</li>
<li>Mix the flour with dashi stock and beaten eggs in a bowl. Peel and grate the nagaimo yam and add to the bowl. Mix in all the ingredients except the pork.</li>
<li>Heat vegetable oil in a non-stick pan and pour the batter. Fry over medium to high heat for about 3 minutes (don't cover or touch).</li>
<li>Place the sliced pork on top. Shake the pan and remove the okonomiyaki bottom from the frying pan. Flip over when the edge of the batter starts to brown (the batter is quite runny, so it might be difficult.)</li>
<li>After flipping over, cover with a lid and reduce heat to low. Fry for about 6 minutes and flip over when the bottom of the okonomiyaki is evenly browned. Cover with a lid and fry for another 3 minutes. Uncover and fry for another 3 minutes. Done!</li>
<li>I noted the cooking time as 3 min → 6 min → 3 min → 3 min but my husband usually doesn't use a timer! When both sides are nicely browned like the top photo, it's ready. In the last 3 minutes, uncover and fry until crispy. This okonomiyaki has lots of nagaimo yam so the fluffy and soft texture remains even after cooking too long.</li>
<li>Serve with your favorite toppings.</li>
<li>My husband may change the ratio or ingredients in the future, so I will keep you posted.</li>
</ol>
<p>The style and the ingredients of okonomiyaki also depend on the region, the two most prominent varieties are the Osaka and Hiroshima-style The Osaka type, also referred to as Kansai, is considered to be the traditional and more popular variety, where the condiments are usually mixed. Our okonomiyaki is pleasantly light-tasting as it uses no lard. Managed by a big music fan, Kazucyan has a constant stream of music playing. Come here to savor okonomiyaki that is soft and fluffy, yet firm. Discover different types of Japanese pancakes, savoury okonomiyaki, fluffy hot cakes, and sweet dorayaki pancakes.</p>
