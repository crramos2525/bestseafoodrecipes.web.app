<li>If you are using a sausage with high fat content (such as pork), you want saute them until grease is brought out and set aside on some paper towels (underneath and on top) to drain. I use venison, which is a very lean sausage, so I skip this step.</li>
<li>In small pot, cover 8 eggs with one inch of water and bring to boil,cook for 7 minutes then place eggs in ice water bath. When cool, peel and set aside.</li>
<li>In a large Dutch oven, heat your vegetable oil on medium high. When it begins to ripple, drop a little bit of your flour onto it. If it immediately begins frying, your oil is ready.
