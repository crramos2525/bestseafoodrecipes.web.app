<li>Add your most dense vegetables [i.e., snap peas, water chestnuts, red/white onions, diakon radishes, carrots, jalapeños, etc.] to your heated pan. Fry vegetables on high for 3 minutes. Stir regularly.</li>
<li>Add your least dense vegetables [i.e., cabbage, mushrooms, basil, cilantro and sprouts] to your pan and fry for 1 minute longer. You'll want some crisp to your cabbage so don't over fry.</li>
<li>Add your pre-steamed shrimp and noodle mixture to your sizzling Wok. Mix well and fry for 1 minute longer covered. Add additional broth if needed or desired.</li>
<li>2 lbs pre-steamed, pre-shucked, de-veined shrimp.</li>

Also, lime wedges and fresh Thai Basil.  -  - Garnish noodle dish with sesame seeds and fresh cilantro. Enjoy!</li>
