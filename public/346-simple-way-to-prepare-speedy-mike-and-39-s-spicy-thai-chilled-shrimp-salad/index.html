<h5 id="steps-to-make-mike39s-spicy-thai-chilled-shrimp-salad">Steps to make Mike's Spicy Thai Chilled Shrimp Salad:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Peel your cucumbers, cut off ends and slice in half. Scrape seeds out with a spoon.</li>
<li>Cut cucumbers into 1&quot; pieces.</li>
<li>Place cucumbers into a strainer and add 1 tbsp salt to them. Mix well and let set for 30 minutes to drain.</li>
<li>In the meantime, split jalapeños and remove seeds with spoon.</li>
<li>Fine dice jalapeños. Add to bowl. Wear gloves!</li>
<li>Smash and fine dice garlic cloves. Add to bowl.</li>
<li>Add your rinsed sprouts to bowl. Left whole.</li>
<li>Dice your Thai Chilies. Add to bowl. Wear gloves!</li>
<li>Peel your Diakon Radish.</li>
<li>Chop and add radishes to bowl.</li>
<li>Peel one end of your fresh ginger and grate. Add to bowl.</li>
<li>Add your Lemon Grass to bowl.</li>
<li>Add your Dried Shrimp to bowl.</li>
<li>Gently wipe clean your Oyster Mushrooms with a damp paper towel. Do not rinse as they will absorb all of that water.</li>
<li>Chop your Water Chestnuts and add to bowl.</li>
<li>Rough chop mushrooms. Add to bowl.</li>
<li>Slice your purple onions and add to bowl.</li>
<li>Pick fresh leaves from Thai Basil stems.</li>
<li>Rough chop and add to bowl.</li>
<li>Pull your fresh cilantro leaves and add to bowl.</li>
<li>Rinse your cucumbers and dab dry with a paper towel. Add to bowl.</li>
<li>Mix salad gently but well. Then, refrigerate.</li>
<li>Bring a small pot of water to a boil and add your snap peas. You'll need to blanche these to soften them up a bit and kill any bacteria. Blanche for 2 minutes even.</li>
<li>Have a bowl of ice water ready to immediately submerge them into to stop the cooking process. Allow them to chill fully.</li>
<li>In the meantime - make your sauce.</li>
<li>In a small pot add everything in the sauce section. Bring to a simmer until sugar has dissolved. This may seem like it's not enough to coat your vegetable mixture - I assure you it is. Allow sauce to completely cool. You don't want your vegetables going limp.</li>
<li>Add snap peas to your refrigerated mixture.</li>
<li>Add cooled sauce mixture to your bowl. Gently mix well. Place back in fridge and allow it to absorb all flavors for 30 minutes minimum. Then, place in a decorative bowl. Allow dish to chill 10 minutes longer in fridge so your dried shrimp can plump a bit.</li>
<li>Garnish dish with Thai Basil and sesame seeds. Serve with lime wedges, soy sauce, Garlic Siracha, chopsticks and Asian spoons.</li>
<li>Serve with a quality Sake. Enjoy!</li>
