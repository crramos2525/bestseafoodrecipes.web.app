<script></script>
<h5 id="steps-to-make-from-scratch-lobster-bisque">Steps to make From Scratch Lobster Bisque:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Boil the lobsters in an 8 quart stock pot until they are red and pretty well cooked, between 10 and 15 minutes or so.</li>
<li>Reserve 10 cups of the boiling water, as this will be the base of the bisque.</li>
<li>Break down the lobster into meat and shells/carcasses, placing the shells back into the reserved water and setting aside the meat.</li>
<li>Boil the shells/carcasses about ten minutes, and then discard the shells/carcasses while saving the water.</li>
<li>Set the water aside, place the oil, butter, onion, carrot, celery, salt, bay, garlic, and cayenne into a large frying pan, and sweat it all out a bit.  Yes, it is a lot of butter, but bisque is buttery.</li>
<li>Deglaze the veggie mix with wine, let the alcohol burn off a few moments, and then transfer the frying pan contents into a blender.  Puree.</li>
<li>Add the veggie sludge to the lobster water, mix well, and simmer on medium low.</li>
<li>Add the tomato paste, and mix really well to get the blobs out.</li>
<li>Add the heavy cream.  Yes, it is a lot of cream, but bisque is creamy.  Mix.</li>
<li>Take a cup of the broth, let it cool a few minutes, and mix the cornstarch into it.</li>
<li>Add the cornstarch mixture back to the broth, mix it in, and then simmer and stir to thicken, for about 20 minutes or so.</li>
<li>Mince the lobster meat, and then add it to the broth.  Don't add it sooner, else you may create rubbery meat bits.</li>
<li>Serve immediately, though it might still be a bit thin.  It will thicken by the next day, though.  If I had you add more cornstarch, it would be all congealed by the next day.</li>
