<p>Chicken rice balls (a.k.a. onigiri) make a delicious snack, a tasty lunch, or a supremely easy dinner—just add a salad or some roasted or grilled vegetables. Chicken is cooked in a simple marinade before being mixed with short-grain rice and pressed into balls. The result is much more flavor-wise.</p>
<p>Chicken Stuffed Rice Balls is one of the most well liked of current trending foods in the world. It is simple, it is quick, it tastes yummy. It&rsquo;s appreciated by millions every day. They&rsquo;re fine and they look wonderful. Chicken Stuffed Rice Balls is something that I&rsquo;ve loved my whole life.</p>
<p>To get started with this recipe, we have to prepare a few components. You can have chicken stuffed rice balls using 12 ingredients and 12 steps. Here is how you cook it.</p>

<script></script>

</ol>
<p>My husband's brother-in-law ordered this Buffalo Chicken Arancini - A delicious twist on an Italian classic. Chicken rice balls are basically chicken rice moulded into a ball, like a chicken rice onigiri of sorts. You can choose between steamed, roasted, and soya sauce chicken. To make this Sicilian cheese-filled rice balls recipe, you first have to make risotto, then use the risotto to make cheese-stuffed balls, then coat them with breadcrumbs and deep-fry them.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="steps-to-make-chicken-stuffed-rice-balls">Steps to make Chicken Stuffed Rice Balls:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Soak rice in water for 1 hour. Chop veggies, chop garlic and dhania finely</li>
<li>Add minced chicken in bowl together with red, yellow and green bell peppers, salt, black and white pepper, grated carrots, dhania, paprika and garlic</li>
<li>Add beaten egg into the chicken mixture and mix thoroughly</li>
<li>Drain the rice and add in grated carrots and dhania, mix well</li>
<li>Oil your hands. Scoop medium sized round chunks of the chicken mixture and form into round balls</li>
<li>Dip the chicken mixture into the rice mixture and coat well. Press gently so the rice mixture is evenly coated on the chicken balls</li>
<li>Repeat until all the chicken balls are coated with the rice mixture</li>
<li>Arrange the rice balls on a mettalic sieve. We will be steaming them</li>
<li>Pour water in a large sufuria the same size as the sieve. Place the sieve with the rice balls on top of the sufuria with the water and cover with a lid</li>
<li>On medium high heat steam the rice balls until both the rice and minced chicken is cooked through</li>
<li>To be sure chicken and rice is cooked the rice should have &quot;porcupine&quot; like spikes on top</li>
<li>Serve over a bed of lettuce</li>
</ol>
<p>It's a labor of love that will make other people love you, which is reason enough to give this recipe a try. Set aside to cool slightly while preparing filling. Dip each rice ball in beaten egg then roll in panko to coat evenly. Since olden days, the locals have shaped the chicken rice into balls to make it easier for workers to carry to their workplace for lunch. Hainanese make this kind of rice ball usually the make to serve Hainanese Chicken rice.</p>
