<h5 id="steps-to-make-our-family39s-homemade-ramen">Steps to make Our Family's Homemade Ramen:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Knead the noodle dough. I used the &quot;noodle dough&quot; program of a GOPAN bread machine.</li>
<li>Put the kneaded dough a plastic bag. Step on the dough over the bag, fold the dough, put the dough back in the bag and step on it again. Repeat 3 to 4 times.</li>
<li>Form the dough into a ball, and rest for about 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Dust a work surface, and divide the dough into 4 portions.</li>
<li>Use a pasta machine on the thickest setting to roll out the dough once. Use the second-thickest setting and roll it out twice. Then use the next thinner setting to roll it out twice.</li>
<li>Cut the rolled out dough using the thin (2 mm) noodle setting.</li>
<li>Dust the cut noodles, and squeeze them tightly with your hands. De-tangle the squeezed noodles, then squeeze them again and de-tangle. Repeat this several times until the noodles are very curly (like commercial ramen noodles).</li>
<li>Dust the noodles generously and de-tangle them into portion sized hanks. Put the hanks in a storage container like Tupperware, and let it rest in the refrigerator for 1-2 days.</li>
<li>Make marinated eggs. -  - <a href="https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/146811-soft-set-seasoned-eggs-with-okonomiyaki-sauce">https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/146811-soft-set-seasoned-eggs-with-okonomiyaki-sauce</a></li>
<li>Blanch the bean sprouts. Rehydrate the wakame seaweed by soaking it in water.</li>
<li>Boil the noodles from Step 8 for about 2 minutes. Drain well.</li>
<li>Put your favorite soup base in a bowl and add 300 ml of boiling water. Add the cooked noodles, bean sprouts and egg. Top with char siu pork slices, corn, and nori seaweed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Making ramen from scratch is pretty darn elaborate. Try our easy, homemade shoyu ramen recipe, which calls for making (No, we're not making our own noodles this time around. I'm taking it easy on you for now.) Our shoyu ramen recipe calls for making four important components: dashi and tare. And my ecookbook recipe ingredient list just. Homemade ramen is the best, and this easy recipe has a garlic broth that will make your tastebuds go crazy.</p>
