<p>Until then the autumn had been mellow, soft. The leaves had lingered on the trees, golden red, and the hedge-rows were still green. Perhaps, thought Nat, munching his pasty by the cliff's edge, a message comes to the birds in autumn, like a warning. An Autumn Foraging Walk for Chestnuts and Chequers. Mushroom Foraging in Banstead, Surrey, Giant Puffballs and more.</p>
