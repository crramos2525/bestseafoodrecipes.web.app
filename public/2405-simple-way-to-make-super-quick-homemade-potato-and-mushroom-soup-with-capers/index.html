<ol>
<li>Melt/heat butter and oil in a medium pot. Saute the onions on medium low heat until softened.</li>
<li>Add mushrooms and a sprinkle of salt &amp; pepper, and continue to saute until mushrooms are very soft and release their juices.</li>
<li>Add potatoes, mix up in the onions and mushrooms for a few minutes. Then pour in enough broth to just reach the top of the potatoes. Bring to a boil, turn heat to low and simmer, covered, for 15 minutes or until potatoes are soft.</li>
<li>After potatoes are soft, stop heat and pour in milk. Blend the soup with a hand blender or mixer until creamy. If too thick, add a little bit more milk as you like.</li>
<li>Adjust taste with salt and pepper if needed. Serve into bowls, garnish with chopped capers and a drizzle of lemon olive oil.</li>
</ol>
