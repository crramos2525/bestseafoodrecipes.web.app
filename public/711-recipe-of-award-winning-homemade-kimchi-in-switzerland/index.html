<h5 id="steps-to-make-homemade-kimchi-in-switzerland">Steps to make Homemade Kimchi in Switzerland!:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Ready the cabbage night before.</li>
<li>Using knife to make cross cut on the bottom of the cabbage.</li>
<li>Tear them apart into quarter. Repeat the process.</li>
<li>Cut the bottom stem.</li>
<li>Chop them into little bigger than bite size.</li>
<li>Put cabbage into big case or in my case cleaned sink. Sprinkle salt and give cabbage a masssage.</li>
<li>Put all cabbage into a drain bowl or case to drain all the excess water from cabbage. Make sure you put something heavy on top to help drain over night.</li>
<li>Cabbage : next day (most of the water was drained)</li>
<li>Wash the cabbage throughly and squeeze. Leave the cabbage and help dry naturally.</li>
<li>Prepare the kimchi glue. Put dried kombu into the water minimum 30 minutes to get bigger and softened.</li>
<li>Once kombu is bigger and softened, put all into a pot and start heating with low heat. Stop the heat once it’s started to bubble. (I did too much)</li>
<li>Mix rice flour or starch with water (not in the ingredients list).</li>
<li>Pour the mix into the pot.</li>
<li>Turn on the heat (low) and mix continuously until it becomes glue texture. Leave it aside.</li>
<li>Start making kimchi paste.</li>
<li>Chop daikon radish, carrot and chives/wild garlic into 10cm long stick.</li>
<li>Sprinkle the salt (not in the ingredients list) and give it a massage. Leave them for minimum 30 mins to 1 hour to excess water.</li>
<li>Grind ginger and chop the garlics.</li>
<li>Add apple sauce. If you are using fresh whole apple, put ginger, garlic and apple into blender and make paste.</li>
<li>Chop anchovies and add to the bowl.</li>
<li>Add fish sauce, sesame oil / toasted sesame, and sugar.</li>
<li>Mix all well.</li>
<li>Prepare chili flakes. Pour chili flakes into the paste. (in my case it my bowl was too small so I sprinkle the rest of chili into veggies)</li>
<li>Paste with chili, veggies with chili, and glue.</li>
<li>Mix them all well. This is the yangnyoem aka kimchi paste.</li>
<li>Mix the cabbage and yangnyeom.</li>
<li>Start putting them in a jar.</li>
<li>If you got left over yangnyoem, do not throw. Please keep in another jar or ziplock bag. You can use this yangnyoem to pickle other ingredients!</li>
<li>Leave bottled kimchi in room temperature for a night. This will help kimchi fermentation.</li>
<li>You can store them in a fridge. Also can enjoy after 2-3 days. Best starts after a week.</li>
<li>Make sure you will open the jar everyday to let gas go. I usually open every morning and mix inside to let go the gasses.</li>
</ol>
