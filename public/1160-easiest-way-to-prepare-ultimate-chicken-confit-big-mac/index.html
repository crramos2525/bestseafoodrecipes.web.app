<p>Hey everyone, I hope you are having an incredible day today. Today, I will show you a way to make a special dish, chicken confit big mac. One of my favorites. For mine, I am going to make it a little bit unique. This will be really delicious.</p>
<p>You can use fat like duck fat, goose fat or you can also use. Confit is the act of preserving or slow-cooking meat in fat. Our version uses olive oil for an extremely juicy chicken and a nice crispy skin.</p>
<p>Chicken Confit Big Mac is one of the most popular of recent trending meals on earth. It is appreciated by millions daily. It&rsquo;s easy, it&rsquo;s fast, it tastes delicious. They&rsquo;re fine and they look fantastic. Chicken Confit Big Mac is something that I&rsquo;ve loved my entire life.</p>
<p>To get started with this recipe, we must prepare a few ingredients. You can have chicken confit big mac using 22 ingredients and 17 steps. Here is how you cook that.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-chicken-confit-big-mac">The ingredients needed to make Chicken Confit Big Mac:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Prepare  Chicken Confit:</li>
<li>Get  Chicken Thighs Boneless with Skin on,</li>
<li>Get  Dried Thyme,</li>
<li>Make ready  Dried Rosemary,</li>
<li>Take  Sea Salt,</li>
<li>Prepare  White Pepper,</li>
<li>Get  Garlic,</li>
<li>Take  Bay Leaf Break Into 2</li>
<li>Prepare  Canola / Peanut / Vegetable Oil, For Confit</li>
<li>Get  White Wine Sauce:</li>
<li>Get  Unsalted Butter,</li>
<li>Take  Shallots Finely Minced,</li>
<li>Prepare  White Wine Preferably Sauvignon Blanc,</li>
<li>Take  Homemade Vegetable Stock,</li>
<li>Get  Big Mac:</li>
<li>Make ready  Big Mac Style Burger Buns,</li>
<li>Make ready  Parmigiano Reggiano Freshly Grated,</li>
<li>Make ready  Gruyere Freshly Shredded,</li>
<li>Take  Kewpie Mayo,</li>

</ol>
<p>Or try one of my favorite creations: Whole wheat BBQ Place the thighs into a roasting pan large enough to hold all the chicken, but not so big you can't cover it with oil. &quot;Can you please explain the process of confit? I know the classic is duck, but there must be other foods that use this technique. I am kind of hiding in shame just not getting it when reading instructions for this. Slow Cooker Chicken Confit: I remember the days when the word &quot;confit&quot; was a rare treat I could only order at a fancy restaurant.</p>
