<li>The chili pepper powder and the semi-crushed sesame seeds will absorb the moisture and thicken the sauce, which is why there are lots of both added.</li>
<li>Lay a bed of shiso leaves on a plate and place the oysters on top. Also add some shredded Japanese leek to cleanse your palate. It's done!</li>
<li>The oysters are so milky. There is not even any smell left. Even though the flavoring is so simple&hellip; it tastes just like fresh liver sashimi.</li>
<li>Korean chili pepper powder is really not that spicy. It's a type of pepper that gives a sweet flavor and nice aroma.</li>
<li>But it is, of course, a chili pepper. So it is naturally a bit spicy. Adjust the amount to taste.</li>
</ol>
<p>Stir in mushrooms, bell pepper, zucchinis and It was delicious! I didn't have red chili paste, so I replaced it with red curry paste and skipped thr oyster sauce for a vegan version. Smoked Oysters with Red Chili Pepper. Smoked Oysters are naturally smoked, and are of uniform size and color. I really like the Ocean Prince Smoked Oysters with Red Chile Peppers.</p>
