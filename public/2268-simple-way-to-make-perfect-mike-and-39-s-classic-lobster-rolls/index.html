<p>Both classic and Connecticut-style (with drenched butter). But making an excellent lobster roll&ndash;that's a whole different story. Dock &amp; Roll Diner: Austin, Texas A traditional Maine-style lobster roll tossed lightly in Dock &amp; Roll's special house dressing and drizzled with seasoned lemon butter. &quot;I grew up in Massachusetts,&quot; says chef Mike Lata, &quot;and that's the lobster roll that I grew up eating.&quot; Now, lobster is a treat and costs a fortune. I've paid over ten dollars for one of these lobster rolls in Cape Cod and it wasn't half as good or half as This is a classic New England sandwich best served on a regular ol' hot dog bun which I prefer grilled. (Pepperidge Farm is my favorite) I use big, meaty.</p>

<h5 id="instructions-to-make-mike39s-classic-lobster-rolls">Instructions to make Mike's Classic Lobster Rolls:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Add everything in the, &quot;Lobster Meat Mixture,&quot; category except for the lobster in a large bowl and mix well. You will need more mayo than is called for. Tablespoon by tablespoon add more mayonnaise until it reaches the creamy consistency you desire. I usually add 3 additional tablespoons.</li>
<li>De-thaw your lobster tails in water if frozen. Do not steam/boil/cook frozen.</li>
<li>Once thawed, cut the underside of your lobster tails lengthwise and remove meat. Rinse lobster meat and discard anything you deem undesirable.</li>
<li>Fill 1-1/2&quot; of water and 2 tablespoons butter in a pot with a tight fitting lid. Bring to a boil and add lobster meat. Reduce heat to low and simmer/steam lobster meat for 5 to 6 minutes.</li>
<li>Once cooked, place on plate to cool. Chop lobster meat and add to lobster meat mixture and mix. Place in fridge until fully chilled.</li>
<li>Carefully tear 4 lengthwise rolls from the other 8. Then another 4 lengthwise rolls from the 8. This will leave you with 3 long sweet sub rolls each consisting of 4 mini rolls. Note: There are also King's Hawaiian Mini Sub Rolls available now that come in packs of 6 and are pre-split. I've used those in the photo below. You can find these rolls in the deli section of your local supermarket.</li>
<li>Carefully slice lengthwise down the side of your roll [if using the 12 pack] to create an opening for your lobster meat without cutting it completely in half.</li>
<li>You can use these rolls as they are or butter and sear them in a hot pan. If I sear them, I lightly butter the rolls and lightly sprinkle with garlic powder.</li>
<li>Smear a layer of guacamole on one side of your roll. Add shredded lettuce and pile on your lobster meat mixture. Sprinkle liberally with Old Bay Seasoning and a pinch of Celery Salt. Also, add a long, thin dill pickle spear at the top of sandwich and serve with Salt &amp; Vinegar Chips to cut some of the richness.</li>
<li>To reduce the overall carbs, you can use low carb bread and omit the guacamole.</li>
