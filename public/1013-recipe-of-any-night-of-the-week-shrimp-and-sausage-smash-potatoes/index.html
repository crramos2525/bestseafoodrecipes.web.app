<ol>
<li>Scrub, wash, and clean potatoes, and cut in smaller cubes.</li>
<li>I boil my potatoes in seasoned water. While they are cooking, cut and dice the veggies, and sausages. I also add some seasonings to the cut up veggies and sausages in a bowl, and toss around to coat in seasonings.</li>
<li>Boil potatoes until pretty soft(So they can be partly smashed later). Drain.</li>

<li>Add rotel, garlic, let it boil, add shrimp &amp; cooked veggies back in &amp; anymore seasonings. turn down to low simmer until shrimp is heated.</li>
<li>Remember, i used precooked/steamed in old bay from kroger, so mine only needed to be re-heated from where i had put in fridge earlier that day.</li>
<li>Add mixture over semi smashed potatoes on plate.</li>
<li>If u like more firm cooked potatoes, you can do that too. I just like mine softer with a little smash and with some bigger pieces of potatoes too.</li>
<li>Also, If you like crunchier veggies, or have uncooked shrimp that hasnt been predone, you can just not saute veggies, and add it with the uncooked shrimp into the rotel, and it will cook it all.

<p>Crispy brown fingerling potatoes are topped with homemade sausage gravy, cheese curds, and pickled peppers to make this deliciously decadent brunch dish. Reviews for: Photos of Smashed Fingerling Potatoes with Sausage Gravy. Spicy Shrimp, Corn, Sausage, and Potatoes Recipe. I'm not knocking the boiling method—it's a Southern classic for a reason—but I find that sauteing the sausage and shrimp separately instead of boiling them with the potatoes and corn enhances the flavors a little more. Shrimp is boiled with potatoes, corn, smoked sausage, onion and seasonings.</p>
