<p>To get started with this recipe, we have to first prepare a few components. You can have nanohana and squid with gochujang using 12 ingredients and 7 steps. Here is how you cook that.</p>

<p>Ojingeochae (오징어채) literally means 'julienned squid' but it somehow always refers to dried squid that is seasoned and cut into thin strips. Ojingeo is squid, and bokkeum refers to the dishes that are stir-fried. Koreans love squid, and this spicy dish is highly popular at home and restaurants. For this dish, the squid is cut into bite-sized pieces and stir-fried in a slightly sweet gochujang (Korean red chili pepper paste) based sauce along with some vegetables.</p>

<h5 id="instructions-to-make-nanohana-and-squid-with-gochujang">Instructions to make Nanohana and Squid with Gochujang:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Make the gochujang sauce. Combine the ☆ ingredients in the listed order. You can store it in the refrigerator for a few days.</li>
<li>Cut 5 mm off the stem ends of the nanohana. Soak in lukewarm water for a while then drain. This makes them firm and crisp even after they are boiled.</li>
<li>Bring plenty of water to a boil in a pot and add salt. Quickly blanch the peeled squid in the boiling water first and take it out to strain out the water. When it has cooled down, cut into 5 mm thick, 3-4 cm long pieces.</li>
<li>Boil the nanohana in the Step 3 boiling water. Put the stem ends in first, then push the rest in and boil quickly. Strain and refresh in cold water immediately. Squeeze out excess water.</li>
<li>Cut the Step 4 nanohana into 4 cm long pieces. Slice the thick parts of the stems in half lengthwise.</li>
<li>Put the Step 3 squid and Step 5 nanohana in a bowl. Add some of the Step 1 gochujang sauce.</li>
<li>Transfer to serving plates and it's done.  You can add some additional ground sesame seeds (not listed) on top if you like.</li>
</ol>
<p>The squid will lose its flavor if submerged in water too long. Steaming the squid briefly works well too. For the seasoning, I first make chili oil by mixing gochugaru (Korean red chili pepper flakes) with heated oil. Then, add gochujang (Korean red chili pepper paste) and other ingredients, and bring everything to a boil only up until it. At Momo restaurant, I also tried Gae Jang Baek Ban (Spicy Raw Crab) for the first time.</p>
