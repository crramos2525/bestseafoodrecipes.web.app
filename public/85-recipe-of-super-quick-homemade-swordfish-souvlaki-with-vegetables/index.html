<p>Mexican souvlaki is made of alternating prawn and courgette chunks threaded on a skewer. For extra taste they are marinated from three to twelve hours in a spice mix and basted with fresh egg-and-lemon mixed with finely-chopped onion. You can also order swordfish, prawn or vegetable souvlaki. Remove fish from skewers. (Alternatively, cook fish in a heated well-seasoned ridged grill pan in same manner.)
