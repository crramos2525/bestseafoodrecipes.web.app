<li>If you use normal dried tomatoes (notsoak the dried tomatoes in hot water to soften for 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
<li>After the dried tomatoes are softened cut roughly. If they are small ones you don't need to cut them.</li>
<li>Add A ingredients into a 16 to 18-cm thick-bottomed pot. Cook over a low heat. You can use a frying pan. Look at Step 12 and 13.</li>
<li>When the garlic is fragrant add B ingredients. Continue to cook until the garlic is golden brown and other ingredients infuse the oil.</li>
<li>When the garlic is golden brown add the onion and fry.</li>
<li>Fry the onion slowly for 5 minutes and stir all the way through to enhance the sweetness of the onion.</li>
<li>After 5 minutes add the cooked octopus and stir altogether.</li>
<li>Add C ingredients into Step 7. Bring to the boil and leave to stand for 30 seconds to evaporate the alcohol.</li>
<li>Add D ingredients to Step 8 and turn the heat to very low. Stir occasionally and simmer slowly for 40 to 50 minutes.</li>
<li>When some of the liquid has evaporated as in this photo, stir occasionally and continue to reduce a little further. Turn off the heat.</li>
<li>Reduce until the sauce drops off the wooden spatula when lifted. The flavour has now been deepened.</li>
<li>The cooking time differs according to the ingredient amount/ the diameter of the pan/ the heat. When you use a frying pan the sauce will be reduced faster.</li>
<li>Ideally use a pot with a little depth and cook over a low heat. You will have tender octopus in this way.</li>
<li>After the sauce is reduced at Step 10 add the dried oregano. Season with salt and pepper if necessary. Sprinkle with parsley.</li>
<li>You can eat it straight away but it is better to leave to stand for several hours. It deepens the flavour.</li>
<li>Use the sauce for pasta. When you serve it as tapas serve warm or cold.</li>
<li>[For the pasta:] Bring 3 L of water to the boil in a large pot. Add 2 tablespoons of salt (1% of salt) just before it comes to boil.</li>
<li>The cooking liquid is a factor deciding the taste of the resultant dish. Measure the amount of salt precisely.</li>
<li>Put the pasta in Step 17 and cook until al dente. Drain the pasta 30 seconds to 1 minute earlier than the package instruction says. Cook over a low heat.</li>
<li>Put 200 ml of Step 14 sauce in a frying pan for 80 g of pasta.</li>
<li>Add 50 ml of pasta cooking liquid just before the pasta is cooked. Keep the heat to very low and do not boil down the sauce.</li>
<li>Add the drained pasta to Step 21 over a low to medium heat. Mix all together.</li>
<li>Plate the pasta.  Sprinkle with parsley/ salt and pepper to your taste.</li>
<li>I used linguine in this photo but use any pasta short or long.</li>
<li>I am proud of this dish and it is seriously tasty. A great combination of octopus, black olives and spicy hot tomato sauce.</li>
<li>Is octopus and olives aglio e olio. It takes just 10 minutes to make. -  - <a href="https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/156067-basil-scented-aglio-e-olio-with-octopus-and-olives">https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/156067-basil-scented-aglio-e-olio-with-octopus-and-olives</a></li>
