<li>Add 50 ml of the water you used to cook the pasta to Step 3. Add this to Step 10's pan and cook over a medium heat for 15 seconds to emulsify the sauce.</li>
<li>[Note] Emulsifying the sauce is important. At home you cook a small amount of pasta so you cannot get enough starch to emulsify the sauce.</li>
<li>By adding the flour the resultant sauce will have the right consistency. You will have a restaurant-quality sauce at home.</li>
<li>Turn the heat to low-high and add the drained pasta. Stir well.</li>
<li>I like it as it is but add more rock salt (not listed in the ingredients) if necessary.</li>
<li>Transfer to a serving dish and garnish with coriander leaves. Sprinkle with lemon juice and black pepper to your liking.</li>
<li>Prawns sautéed in white wine and fish sauce really give this dish an exquisite taste. And combined with the coriander stalks just further adds to it.</li>
<li>If you don't mind fish sauce or coriander I really recommend this Asian-style spaghetti aglio e oilo.</li>
<li>Here's my Basic Spaghetti aglio e olio.</li>
<li>is a spaghetti aglio e olio with anchovies. This is nice too.</li>
</ol>
<p>With a salad and bread, it can be an emergency meal. Here goes the simplest and most basic Italian pasta: Spaghetti aglio e olio. Spaghetti Aglio e Olio is a classic Italian pasta dish made with simple ingredients like garlic (lots of it), oil, chili flakes sometimes and cheese. Super favorite if I must emphasize. My first exposure to Aglio E Olio was decades ago at Pasta de Waraku in Singapore and I have since declared that I have fallen.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s going to wrap this up for this exceptional food asian-style spaghetti aglio e olio with coriander recipe. Thank you very much for reading. I am confident you can make this at home. There&rsquo;s gonna be interesting food in home recipes coming up. Remember to save this page in your browser, and share it to your loved ones, friends and colleague. Thanks again for reading.
