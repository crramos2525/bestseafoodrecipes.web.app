<li>The eggs, for this recipe you need 3 yolks. Pour them into a bowl and add the grated Parmesan cheese, pepper, salt. Beat with a whisk</li>
<li>Make sure there are no bones in the salmon and skin off the swordfish. Then proceed by cutting into cubes, a couple of cm large, the tuna, the salmon and the swordfish.</li>
<li>Boil a water and throw the pasta and cook it up to a couple of minutes before optimal cooking.</li>

<li>Add the white wine. When the alcohol evaporates, set the fish cubes aside, drain them with a skimmer and lower the heat. As soon as the pasta is al dente, take a ladleful of water and pour it into the pan.</li>
<li>Drain the spaghetti and put them in pot. Then cook for about a minute, stirring continuously, so that the starches are released from the pasta, and adding cooking water as needed. Add the fish cubes. Remove from hob, then pour the egg yolk and mix well.</li>
<li>Your carbonara di mare is ready, serve still very hot and garnish, to taste, with grated pepper</li>
</ol>
<p>In a clever play on carbonara, Food &amp; Wine 's Justin Chapple uses smoked Gouda cheese, adding a deliciously smoky flavor to this silky, hearty and totally delicious pasta. Carbonara is a favorite of mine (the base reminds me a bit of the way my grandmother would always make pasta for me), but this Carbonara di Salmone Affumicato was my first time trying the dish with smoked salmon. I will definitely need to keep smoked salmon on hand more often.
