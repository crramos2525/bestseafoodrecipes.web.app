<li>Place your damp rag over your exposed unused egg roll wraps or they will dry out and crack while you're wrapping.</li>
<li>Brush beaten eggs around the edges of the square wrap.</li>
<li>Mix cabbage mixture again and place a small amount on wrap. Shake off excess soy sauce or you'll have soggy rolls. Don't overstuff.</li>
<li>Place one carrot slice and one chive with a few pieces of shrimp on to your wrap.</li>
<li>Begin to wrap contents tightly up within the wrap.</li>
<li>At the middle of rolling your wrap, place more egg mixture at the ends [inside and outside] and fold them tightly inward. Do whatever you can to avoid having any holes or gaps in your wrap.</li>
<li>Continue rolling until you reach the end of wrap.</li>
<li>Make certain all of your edges are sealed. If they're not, add more egg mixture and pinch the ends to make a tighter seal. Don't worry about using too much egg mixture other than running out of it. If that happens, just beat another egg.</li>
<li>If there are any holes or openings, oil will enter your egg roll and make them soggy and oily. If your rolls aren't tightly rolled, they will fall apart so make certain these wraps are as tight as you can make them without splitting your rolls.</li>
<li>Continue to tightly wrap all of your egg rolls and be sure to mix your cabbage mixture and shake off excess soy sauce each time before placing it on your wrap.</li>
<li>Turn on your fryer or heat you oil in your pan until it's at a higher heat.</li>
<li>Add four egg rolls to your heated oil and fry for approximately 2 1/2 minutes flipping them regularly. Any more than adding four rolls to your oil will cause your oil to cool down too much and overcook or over saturate your rolls. Watch them carefully as not to burn. When browned and crispy, place on paper towels to drain.</li>
<li>Continue frying until all rolls are fried to a nice golden brown and drain those as well.</li>
<li>Serve with soy sauce, sweet and sour red sauce or Thai dip and garnish serving tray with shreadded cabbage and Cilantro at its base.</li>
