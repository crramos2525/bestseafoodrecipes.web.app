<p>Great recipe for Damie Checkered Sushi Cake For Mother's Day. I wanted to make a San Sebastian checkerboard cake with sushi rice. It's difficult to slice or mold sushi rice like a cake, so it took a lot of effort to come up with this method.</p>
<p>Damie Checkered Sushi Cake For Mother's Day is one of the most popular of recent trending meals in the world. It is enjoyed by millions every day. It&rsquo;s easy, it&rsquo;s fast, it tastes delicious. Damie Checkered Sushi Cake For Mother's Day is something that I&rsquo;ve loved my whole life. They are nice and they look fantastic.</p>
<p>To begin with this particular recipe, we must prepare a few components. You can have damie checkered sushi cake for mother's day using 11 ingredients and 18 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-damie-checkered-sushi-cake-for-mother39s-day">The ingredients needed to make Damie Checkered Sushi Cake For Mother's Day:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Take 810 grams Sushi rice</li>
<li>Take 1 Sakura denbu (sweetened pink-colored fish flakes)</li>
<li>Get 2 Hanpen</li>
<li>Get 6 slice or 1 sausage Ham or fish sausage</li>
<li>Take 5 slice Smoked salmon</li>
<li>Make ready 1 Shiso leaves etc.</li>
<li>Get 1 Pasta (dried)</li>
<li>Take  Equipment required:</li>
<li>Prepare 1 1/2 Empty milk carton</li>
<li>Get 1 Staples</li>
<li>Get 1 Plastic wrap</li>
</ol>
<p>If you like smoked salmon, that is a perfect ingredient to use in a sushi cake - we live that but the tuna filling it's absolutely gorgeous - we make it every single time without a fail. No canned tuna - no sushi cake - this is how it starts here 😉 but you can get so creative with the layers and the fillings ;-). Cover with plastic wrap, level with rolling pin (remove plastic wrap), and brush with wasabi mixture. Prepare the cake mix as directed; divide the batter between the pans and bake as directed.</p>

<li>When removing the mold, hold down the edges of the sushi rice with a spoon or your hands, and lift the mold up gently from the bottom little by little.</li>
<li>Make and add the decorations. Crush the hanpen in a food processor.</li>
<li>Coat the Step 11 rice base all over with the crumbled hanpen from Step 11.</li>
<li>Cut the ham (or if using fish sausage, use a vegetable peeler to slice it) into strips, form a ribbon, and secure on top of the Step 14 cake with a short piece of pasta.</li>
<li>Wrap the smoked salmon slices to form roses. Fix on top of the cake with shiso leaves, next to the Step 15 ribbon.</li>
<li>Slice the cake Moisten your knife before slicing. The cake is quite thick, so you will need to insert your knife 4-5 times per slice. Moisten the blade each time.</li>
<li>It's difficult and time consuming to slice the cake nicely, so I recommend slicing it first and bringing it to the table already sliced.</li>

<p>I was skeptical the first time I had one, at a party in the suburbs of Tokyo. See more ideas about Sushi cake, Sushi, Sushi party. One of my other fun projects the other week was to make a sushi cake for a little boy, who loves to eat, sushi! So, we decided to go with the usual side kicks of sushi - soy sauce, chopsticks, wasabi dollop, and sliced pickled ginger. Bonus points for you if you can manage to eat cake with chopsticks!</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s going to wrap it up with this special food damie checkered sushi cake for mother's day recipe. Thanks so much for your time. I am sure you can make this at home. There&rsquo;s gonna be interesting food at home recipes coming up. Remember to bookmark this page in your browser, and share it to your family, friends and colleague. Thank you for reading. Go on get cooking!</p>
