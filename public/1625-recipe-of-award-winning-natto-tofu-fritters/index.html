<script></script>
<h5 id="steps-to-make-natto-tofu-fritters">Steps to make Natto Tofu Fritters:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Mix all the ingredients together in a bowl (if the natto came with a sauce packet, put that in too).</li>
<li>Heat oil in a frying pan, and drop spoonfuls of the mixture into the pan.</li>
<li>When each side has been fried to a golden brown color, they are done! They're good on their own, or dipped into ponzu sauce.</li>
<li>If you add ground meat, they will become natto tofu burgers. I think they'd be good with cheese, although that would increase the calories.</li>
<li>[Edit] The mixture is hard to form, so shape them small so that they are easy to flip over.</li>
<li>[Edit] They won't be as fluffy, but if you drain excess moisture from the tofu before making the mixture, it will be easier to form.</li>
<li>I tried it with ginger in the mix as well as on top. Ginger stimulates your digestion.</li>
<li>[As baby food] Mix the split natto, tofu, katakuriko and aonori together, and pan fry in a frying pan coated thinly with vegetable oil. That's all.</li>
<li>[As baby food] You can add a little salt. The mixture is soft, but if you make them small, you can easily flip them.</li>
