<h5 id="steps-to-make-ghee-roast-prawn-tacos">Steps to make Ghee Roast Prawn Tacos:</h5>
<ol>
<li>For making the ghee roast prawns remove the shells from the prawns, clean them and marinate them with the curd, turmeric powder, salt and lemon juice for about 15 minutes</li>
<li>In the mean time soak the red chillies into some hot water</li>
<li>Now let's prepare a roasted spice powder. For that, dry roast the cumin seeds, coriander seeds, fennel seeds, whole black pepper, mustard seeds &amp; fenugreek seeds together in a pan and then grind them into a fine powder</li>
<li>Now remove the red chillies from the soaking water &amp; grind them along with the roasted spice powder into a paste. Add some water during grinding to make sure all the spices are blended well</li>
<li>Now mix the kashmiri red chilli powder into this paste &amp; blend everything one more time</li>
<li>Now take this spice blend into a bowl &amp; mix the garlic paste into it. Keep it aside</li>
<li>Now heat the ghee into a pan &amp; add the marinated prawns into it</li>
<li>Cook for few minutes &amp; when a good amount of liquid comes out of the prawns remove the prawns from the pan. Then cook the leftover liquid for about 3-4 minutes</li>
<li>Now add add the prepared spice blend into the pan &amp; cook for another 2-3 minutes</li>
<li>Now add the salt &amp; tamarind pulp and cook for few more minutes</li>
<li>Now add the prawns back into the pan &amp; cook until the prawns are almost coated with all the spices</li>
<li>Then add the sugar &amp; curry leaves and saute for another 2-3 minutes. Ghee roast prawns are ready. Turn off the flame</li>
<li>Now it's time to prepare the taco shells. For that, take the maize flour &amp; the all purpose flour together in a large utensil and add the vegetable oil &amp; the salt into it. Mix everything very well</li>
<li>Now pour some lukewarm water little at a time into the flour mixture and knead well until you come up with a medium soft dough</li>
<li>Now make few small balls out of the dough, dust each ball with some flour &amp; roll it out into a thin disc</li>
<li>Now take a round cookie cutter or a small circular lid of a bottle &amp; press it at the middle of the disc in order to get a smooth circle that resembles a 'puri'. Remove the extra edges from the 'puri' but don't throw them. These leftover pieces can be used to make more taco shells in the similar manner</li>
<li>Now prick the 'puri' with a fork so that it doesn't puff up during frying. Prepare all the 'puri's in the similar manner</li>
<li>Now heat sufficient oil into a pan &amp; throw one taco 'puri' at a time into the oil. Fry each side of the 'puri' for about 30 seconds</li>
<li>Then take a tong or you can follow the procedure that I used. Take a fork &amp; a spoon and hold them together like a tong. Use this procedure to hold the 'puri' into a half moon shaped structure</li>
<li>Fry the half moon shaped taco shell until it is golden brown. Then remove it from the oil &amp; prepare all the taco shells in the similar manner</li>
<li>Now it's time to prepare the coconut chutney. For that, I have already soaked the chana dal into some hot water for an hour. Now it's time to drain the water from the dal</li>
<li>Now grind the coconut, curry leaves, chana dal and the coriander leaves along with some water into a fine paste. Add the salt into the mixture &amp; the chutney is ready</li>
<li>To prepare the salad mix the chopped cucumber, tomato &amp; coriander leaves together into a bowl and add the lemon juice &amp; the black pepper powder into it</li>
<li>Now add the salt. Mix everything well &amp; the salad is ready</li>
<li>To marinate the onion rings add the chat masala &amp; the red chilli powder into the rings and mix everything well</li>
<li>Now let's assemble the tacos. Take one taco shell at a time, put some salad inside. Then put some ghee roast prawns on top of the salad layer</li>
<li>Now insert some marinated onion rings at one side of the prawns &amp; drizzle some coconut chutney on top</li>
<li>Assemble all the tacos in the similar manner &amp; now they are ready to serve</li>
