<p>Hey everyone, it&rsquo;s Brad, welcome to our recipe site. Today, we&rsquo;re going to make a distinctive dish, singapore hokkien mee recipe. It is one of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I&rsquo;m gonna make it a bit unique. This will be really delicious.</p>
<p>Singapore Hokkien Mee Recipe is one of the most well liked of current trending foods on earth. It is simple, it is fast, it tastes delicious. It&rsquo;s enjoyed by millions every day. Singapore Hokkien Mee Recipe is something which I&rsquo;ve loved my whole life. They are nice and they look fantastic.</p>
<p>Hokkien Char mee from Kuala Lumpur is a fried yellow noodle dish braised in dark soya sauce. Penang Hokkien Prawn Noodles is another Singapore Hokkien Mee recipe - The prawn stock imparts the essence to the noodle and is the key ingredient that makes the bland-looking dish flavourful. Today's recipe is all about cooking Singapore's signature Hokkien Fried Noodles - we Singaporeans called it Fried Hokkien Mee.</p>
<p>To begin with this particular recipe, we have to prepare a few components. You can have singapore hokkien mee recipe using 19 ingredients and 12 steps. Here is how you can achieve it.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-singapore-hokkien-mee-recipe">The ingredients needed to make Singapore Hokkien Mee Recipe:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Get  Prawn Stock:</li>
<li>Get 1.5 liters water</li>
<li>Get 500 g pork bones (or chicken bones) blanched in boiling water for 5 minutes &amp; rinsed</li>
<li>Make ready 500 g local (lala) clams</li>
<li>Make ready 200 g prawn shells</li>
<li>Make ready 1 squid (sotong) insides cleaned</li>
<li>Take 8-12 small or medium prawns with shells on</li>
<li>Get 1 tsp fish sauce to taste</li>
<li>Make ready 1/4 tsp dark soy sauce to taste</li>
<li>Make ready  Hokkien Mee</li>
<li>Take 3 tbsp lard oil (or vegetable oil) divided</li>
<li>Get 2 small eggs lightly beaten</li>
<li>Make ready 250 g yellow noodles</li>
<li>Take 150 g rice vermicelli (bee hoon) usually thick bee hoon is used but thin bee hoon is fine as well</li>
<li>Make ready 60 g bean sprouts</li>
<li>Prepare 1 tbsp minced garlic</li>
<li>Prepare 1/2 tbsp fried lard pieces optional</li>
<li>Prepare 3 stalks Chinese chives (koo chye) cut to 5 cm (2 in) length</li>
<li>Prepare 2 limes halved</li>
</ol>
<p>It is also a dish that is unique to Singapore. I am writing this recipe to document some of the important aspects of frying Hokkien which I have gleaned over the years from some of the best Hokkien mee hawkers in Singapore. Deciding the best Hokkien mee stall in Singapore is very contentious topic. There are effectively two camps preferring either the dry or the wet type.</p>

<h5 id="instructions-to-make-singapore-hokkien-mee-recipe">Instructions to make Singapore Hokkien Mee Recipe:</h5>
<ol>
<li>For making homemade prawn stock: In a soup pot, add water, blanched pork bones, clams, and prawn shells.</li>
<li>When water comes to a rapid boil, add squid and prawns; cook for 2 minutes and remove from pot.</li>
<li>When cooled, peel the prawn shell (leaving the tail on); return the prawn heads and shells back to the soup pot.</li>
<li>Slice the squid to thin rings.</li>
<li>Continue simmering the stock for 40 minutes and strain the broth. Season the stock with fish sauce and dark soy sauce. Yields about 500ml of rich prawn stock.</li>
<li>For making Hokkien Mee: Heat 1 tbsp oil in wok and add beaten egg. Scramble the egg quickly with a spatula until it is semi set.</li>
<li>Add yellow noodles, rice vermicelli, bean sprouts, another tbsp of oil and 2 ladles of prawn stock. Stir fry on high heat for 1 minute.</li>
<li>Push the wok contents to one side, add another 1 tbsp oil to the wok. Stir fry garlic and lard pieces for 15 seconds.</li>
<li>Add chives, mix everything together, add 2 more ladles of stock and cover with lid to simmer/braise for 3 mins.</li>
<li>Turn off the heat. Ladle the remaining stock over the cooked noodles. Return the prepared prawns and squid into the hot wok and mix in evenly with the noodles.</li>
<li>Divide and portion to four serving plates. Serve each plate with a cut lime and some sambal at the side.</li>
<li>PS: Some Hokkien mee is served with pork belly as well. Par-boil a piece of pork belly together with the soup stock. Slice to smaller pieces when cooled and add them to the wok when stir-frying the Hokkien noodles.</li>
