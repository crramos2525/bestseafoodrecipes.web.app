<ol>
<li>Cook the rice in a rice cooker using 80% of the water you'd usually use. Leave to rest after cooking for 10 minutes, and mix with the sushi vinegar while still hot, rapidly cooling it by fanning it with a fan while you mix. Divide into 15 portions (each portion is about 40 g).</li>
<li>While the rice cooks, make the other ingredients ready. Divide the cream cheese into 15 portions, the slice of lemon into 6 pieces, and cut the cherry tomatoes in half.</li>
<li>Slice the avocado on half lengthwise, slice into 8 pieces and slice 3 of those into half (the ones to put inside the sushi). Dice the mango.</li>
<li>Ham and mango sushi:  Moisten a square piece of plastic wrap and put a slice of ham on top, with the nicer looking side facing outwards.</li>
<li>Top with 2/3 of a portion of rice, and put a piece each of cream cheese and mango on top.</li>
<li>Add the rest of the portion of sushi rice.</li>
<li>Gather up the plastic wrap tightly and form into a ball.</li>
<li>Decorate the top with tiny pieces of mango and fresh dill to finish. You can use pineapple instead of mango.</li>
<li>Smoked salmon and salmon caviar sushi:  Put a slice of smoked salmon on top of a moistened piece of plastic wrap in one direction, and put a shiso leaf with the back of the leaf facing upwards on top crosswise so that the leaf sticks out from each side of the salmon slice.</li>
<li>Top with 2/3 of a portion of rice, and put a piece of cream cheese and a little salmon caviar on top of that. Add the rest of the portion of rice.</li>
<li>Wrap tightly to form a round ball shape.</li>
<li>Decorate with a bit of the lemon slice, salmon caviar and dill.</li>
<li>Avocado and shrimp sushi: Put a slice of avocado and a shrimp on the plastic wrap, plus half a cherry tomato with the cut side facing up.</li>
<li>Add 2/3rds of a portion of sushi rice, top with a portion of cream cheese and a small piece of avocado, then the rest of the portion of rice.</li>
<li>Wrap tightly and form into a ball shape.</li>
<li>Take off the wrap and it's done! This one falls apart more easily than the other types so be sure to wrap it tightly.</li>
<li>Egg wrapped sushi (chakin style): Boil the shrimp and cut the snow peas diagonally. Cut a usuyaki tamago (thin omelette) in half and lay on a piece of plastic wrap.</li>
<li>Put a portion of sushi rice that's already been formed into ball on top, wrap up the whole thing tightly and form into ball. Leave like this for a while.</li>
<li>Decorate the top with snow peas, shrimp and salmon caviar to finish. You can put some filling into the rice if you like.</li>
<li>For the sushi vinegar, please refer to. For the usuyaki tamago (thin omelette) please refer to. -  - <a href="https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/169366-foolproof-usuyaki-tamago-thin-omelette-and-kinshi-tamago-shredded-omelette-for-chirashi-sushi">https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/169366-foolproof-usuyaki-tamago-thin-omelette-and-kinshi-tamago-shredded-omelette-for-chirashi-sushi</a></li>
