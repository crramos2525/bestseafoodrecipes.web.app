<ol>
<li>Make the gochujang sauce. Combine the ☆ ingredients in the listed order. You can store it in the refrigerator for a few days.</li>
<li>Cut 5 mm off the stem ends of the nanohana. Soak in lukewarm water for a while then drain. This makes them firm and crisp even after they are boiled.</li>

<p>And the ika pasta isn't really pasta, but rather rice noodles in this mildly spicy dressing that tastes a lot like gochujang (Korean pepper paste). It reminded me a little of like bibimmyeon with squid pieces. We can eat out every day for a few years without going to the same restaurant twice, but we choose to go back to some places time and again because of their food and hospitality.
