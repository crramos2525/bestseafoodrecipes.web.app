<li>Put those in the sieve for a while to remove water or use a kitchen towel.</li>
<li>Put the minced water chestnut, onion, and boiled squid into the hanpen fish cake &amp; tofu mixture and mix well.</li>
<li>To make a richer taste, keep the mixture in the refrigerator for few hours to let the seasoning soak into the mixture. *If you want to cook right away, make sure the soup powder is melted in the mixture.</li>
<li>Take some mixture with a spoon and make a small ball, just like a ping pong ball.</li>
<li>Slice shumai / gyoza sheets.</li>
<li>Roll the dumpling ball on it to put slices all over it.</li>
<li>Shumai sheets are very thin and easy to dry and become hard. I do recommend making all dumpling balls at one time and then cover with thinly sliced shumai sheets quickly.</li>
<li>Pour some water in the steamer, set the base plate, put a cooking sheet on it, and then place the dumplings.</li>
<li>Cover the top with a wrap and then place the steamer's lid to enclose the steam inside the container.</li>
<li>Heat at 600W for 8 mins. and done!</li>
<li>Shumai itself is well seasoned and tasty. It also goes good with mayonnaise or soy sauce &amp; vinegar mixture to dip.</li>
