They&rsquo;re nice and they look wonderful. Okara Cake Salé with Mushroom and Tuna is something that I have loved my entire life.</p>
<p>Okara is a byproduct made from soy usually white or yellowish in color with rich amounts Copper and Selenium along with other nutrients in it. Place the leaves of lettuce on the toast, a pile tablespoon of tuna-okara mixture on top. Sprinkle each with remaining green onion and little paprika.</p>
<p>To begin with this particular recipe, we have to first prepare a few ingredients. You can have okara cake salé with mushroom and tuna using 15 ingredients and 12 steps. Here is how you cook that.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-okara-cake-salé-with-mushroom-and-tuna">The ingredients needed to make Okara Cake Salé with Mushroom and Tuna:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Get  Basic batter (943 kcal)</li>
<li>Take 2 Eggs (large)</li>
<li>Get 80 to 100 ml  Soy milk (or milk)</li>
<li>Make ready 25 grams Olive oil</li>
<li>Prepare 140 grams Fresh okara</li>
<li>Get 60 grams Pancake mix</li>
<li>Prepare 2 heaping tablespoons  Grated cheese</li>
<li>Make ready 1/3 tsp Salt</li>
<li>Take  Additions (about 200 kcal) - or use whatever you have in your refrigerator</li>
<li>Take 1 medium ＊Onion</li>
<li>Take 1 pepper worth ＊Red and yellow bell peppers</li>
<li>Make ready 1 can ＊Canned tuna packed in water</li>
<li>Prepare 30 grams Leafy greens (I used komatsuna and daikon radish tops)</li>
<li>Prepare 100 grams Marinated mushrooms</li>
<li>Prepare 1 dash Salt and pepper</li>
</ol>
<p>Add bell peppers, mushrooms, and tuna. Another way to use up soy pulp (aka okara) is to mix them into pancakes. Whisk egg, okara and chopped spring onion together in a mixing bowl. Canned tuna gets a facelift in easy Creamy Tuna-and-Mushroom Linguine.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="steps-to-make-okara-cake-salé-with-mushroom-and-tuna">Steps to make Okara Cake Salé with Mushroom and Tuna:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Chop the onion finely. Cut the peppers into 1 cm cubes. Drain the tuna and flake, reserving the liquid from the can.</li>
<li>Sauté the onion and pepper in olive oil. Add the mushrooms and liquid from the canned tuna and sauté. Season lightly with salt and pepper.</li>
<li>Boil the greens in salted water, drain and squeeze out very well. Chop finely. Combine with the drained and flaked tuna, spread out on a paper towel lined colander and drain excess moisture.</li>
<li>Make the egg mixture: Add salt and 80 ml of soy milk to the beaten eggs. Add the olive oil little by little to emulsify the liquid.</li>
<li>Prepare the dry ingredients: Combine the okara, pancake mix and grated cheese well with a whisk.</li>
<li>Combine the egg mixture from Step 4 with the Step 2 and 3 ingredients and mix well.</li>
<li>Add the combined Step 4 ingredients to the Step 6 ingredients, and mix until there are no flour streaks. Pour the batter into the pound cake pan. If the batter seems too thick, add a little soy milk to adjust.</li>
<li>Bake in a preheated 180°C oven for 40 minutes. If a bamboo skewer stuck in the middle comes out cleanm it's done. If there is some batter on the skewer, bake for another 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
<li>Let it cool before slicing. Cut into single serving slices. I recommend 2 cm slices. You can freeze it in smaller portions aswell.</li>
<li>Tip 1: After the cake is baked, tap the pan on your work surface to release any built-up steam.</li>
<li>Tip 2: Gently remove the cake from the pan, transfer on a cooling rack and cover loosely with parchment paper. Leave to cool.</li>
<li>It's best to rest the cake in the refrigerator overnight. It not only becomes easier to slice, but the taste and texture of the okara will be reduced and the flavor will mellow out. Serve cold or warmed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Try this recipe a Tuna and Mushroom Bake that can be made on a sheet pan for a quick and easy dinner idea. You might think &quot;fresh&quot; tuna is the best option, but when fish is flash-frozen after it's caught and remains that way until you thaw it for cooking, it will retain quality and be safer to consume. Thanks to these easy tuna recipes, using both fresh and canned fish, you'll have loads of ideas to prepare zesty and flavor-packed healthy dishes all week long. You'll need to fill the base of a pan with veg oil and bring it to a sizzle. It's important to make sure the oil is hot before frying or the patties will absorb too much oil and turn sludgy.</p>
