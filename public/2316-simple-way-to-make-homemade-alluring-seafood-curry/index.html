<p>Hey everyone, it is Brad, welcome to my recipe site. Today, we&rsquo;re going to make a special dish, alluring seafood curry. One of my favorites. This time, I am going to make it a little bit unique. This is gonna smell and look delicious.</p>
<p>Alluring Seafood Curry is one of the most well liked of recent trending foods in the world. It is easy, it&rsquo;s fast, it tastes delicious. It&rsquo;s appreciated by millions daily. They are nice and they look wonderful. Alluring Seafood Curry is something that I&rsquo;ve loved my entire life.</p>
<p>Great recipe for Alluring Seafood Curry. This started out when I used keema curry spice mix I bought at a local store. I used to mix the spices one by one, but nowadays I mix it in advance.</p>
<p>To begin with this recipe, we have to prepare a few ingredients. You can cook alluring seafood curry using 22 ingredients and 12 steps. Here is how you cook that.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-alluring-seafood-curry">The ingredients needed to make Alluring Seafood Curry:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Get 1 enough to serve your party  Shrimp</li>
<li>Take 1 large or 2 medium Squid</li>
<li>Take 250 to 300 grams Asari (Manila clams in their shells, de-sanded and washed)</li>
<li>Prepare 800 ml Water</li>
<li>Take 2 Onions</li>
<li>Prepare 1/4 stalk ● Celery (finely chopped)</li>
<li>Take 2 tbsp ● Ginger (grated)</li>
<li>Take 2 tbsp ● Garlic (grated)</li>
<li>Prepare 4 tbsp Olive oil</li>
<li>Take 50 to 100 ml White wine</li>
<li>Take 3 tbsp Plain yogurt</li>
<li>Take 50 ml Ketchup</li>
<li>Take 1 Black pepper</li>
<li>Make ready 2 tsp Natural salt</li>
<li>Prepare 3 tbsp Flour</li>
<li>Prepare 1 Soy sauce</li>
<li>Get  Spices:</li>
<li>Take 2 to 3 tablespoons Curry powder (store-bought or your own blend)</li>
<li>Make ready 1 1/2 tsp Cumin powder</li>
<li>Take 1 tsp Coriander powder</li>
<li>Take 1/2 to 1 teaspoon Cardamon powder (optional)</li>
<li>Take 1 tsp Garam masala</li>
</ol>
<p>Make sure that you get the freshest squid available (the flesh should be firm to the touch). The addition of curry leaves impart an alluring and exotic &quot;curry&quot; aroma to the dish. This was such a surprise with small chunks of salmon, calamari and other seafood in a thick, red, pasty fiery curry with dry, numbing heat. Seafood like crabs and salmon along with soup curry and dairy products, this island is definitely the food kingdom of Japan.</p>

<h5 id="steps-to-make-alluring-seafood-curry">Steps to make Alluring Seafood Curry:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Start by prepping the shrimp and squid! Peel the shrimp. Cut the body of the squid into 1.5 cm rings, and chop the tentacles. Season both with salt and black pepper. Wash the clams well. Don't throw away the shrimp shells, since we'll use them to make the stock.</li>
<li>Dry-roast the shrimp shells in a frying pan! When they are crispy and fragrant, add water. You can add konbu seaweed and celery leaves etc. at this point too.</li>
<li>When the pan comes to a boil, add the clams! When all the clam shells have opened, the seafood stock is done! Don't simmer for too long or the flavor will deteriorate.</li>
<li>Strain the stock through a sieve lined with cloth into another container such as a bowl. Take the clams out of their shells; we'll add them later to the curry.</li>
<li>Finely chop the onion (you can use a food processor). Put into a microwave cooking container and microwave for 15 minutes, mixing it every 5 minutes.</li>
<li>When the onion is cooking, grate the ● garlic and ● ginger and finely chop the ● celery.</li>
<li>Put olive oil and the ● ingredients into a heavy bottomed pan or a frying pan, and stir fry until fragrant. Add the shrimp and squid and continue stir frying. The squid cooks immediately, so add the shrimp first! Season with about 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Don't add the squid tentacles yet.</li>
<li>Add white wine, cover with a lid, and steam-cook. When the shrimp and squid are heated through, take them out of the pan. Squid gets tough if you overcook it, so be careful. The frying pan will be used in the next step, so don't wash it yet!</li>
<li>Add the microwaved onion, the clams, squid legs, and all the spices (except for the garam masala and flour) to the frying pan and stir-fry.</li>
<li>The roux is done when the mixture has a paste-like consistency! Add the stock made earlier and simmer for 15 minutes. Season with salt, ketchup, soy sauce, or other seasonings of your choice.</li>
<li>Return the cooked shrimp and squid to the pan! Simmer for about 2 minutes, then finish by adding yogurt and garam masala! Best when served immediately.</li>
<li>Seafood tends to degrade in flavor if you simmer it for too long, so aim to cook for less than 30 minutes after adding the seafood to the pan. Plain yogurt is best, but you can use sweetened yogurt, too.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can get hold of the best mouthwatering food of all kinds along with street food here. Layer the seafood, but start with the fish pieces, followed by the rest of the ingredients.
