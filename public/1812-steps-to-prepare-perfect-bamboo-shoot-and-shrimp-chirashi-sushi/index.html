<p>Chirashi Sushi (Chirashizushi) is a kind of Sushi dish with thinly sliced Sashimi raw fish placed over a bed of Sushi Rice, instead of single pieces (Nigiri Sushi) or rolls (Maki Sushi). And for this occasion I have a photo guide for you. There is no fixed recipe and you don't need to use raw fish either if you don't like, but you can add any ingredient you prefer. It is perfect as an appetizer or main course served at room temperature.</p>

<h5 id="instructions-to-make-bamboo-shoot-and-shrimp-chirashi-sushi">Instructions to make Bamboo Shoot and Shrimp Chirashi Sushi:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Cook the rice to a somewhat firm texture (to do this, just use a little less water than usual) in a rice cooker. Add a little salt, sugar, and whatever seasonings you like (suggestions are mirin or dashi stock) to the egg, and cook thin omelets. Julienne to make shredded eggs, and set aside. Discard the heads and tails of the shrimp, blanch in salt water, chop up, and set aside. Blanch the snow peas in salt water, cut diagonally (like in the picture), and set aside.</li>
<li>[Simmer the mixed ingredients] Reconstitute the dried shiitake mushrooms and koya dofu by soaking in lukewarm water, then drain. Cut the shiitake mushrooms, koya dofu, carrot, and bamboo shoot into small pieces, and set aside. The bamboo shoots should be cut a little larger than the other items. Then put all of these ingredients into a pot, add all of the seasonings and broth ingredients marked with ★, and simmer until most of the liquid is gone.</li>
<li>Put the four ingredients marked with ● into a microwave-safe bowl, microwave for about 30 seconds, and stir.  (For the Sushi vinegar)  Turn out the freshly steamed, hot rice into a hangiri (wooden sushi tub), and add sushi vinegar in 3-4 batches while fanning the rice with a hand-held fan. Mixing the rice and vinegar with a spatula, using a cutting motion.</li>
<li>Add the simmered ingredients from Step 2 to the sushi rice from Step 3, toasted white sesame seeds, and mix well. When it's evenly mixed, scatter on the julienned egg crepe, add the chopped shrimp and snow peas on top, and it's done.</li>
<li>Add further toppings as you like. Garnish with nanohana, slices of raw fish, etc., to taste. I prefer my sushi rice a little on the tart side. If you don't like it so tart, just cut back on the amount of vinegar a bit.</li>
</ol>
<p>Scattered Sushi (Chirashi Sushi) is often made for special occasions such as Doll Festival and birthdays. This beautifully arranged sushi is the easiest of all the sushi dishes. Prepare the toppings of your choice, scatter them on sushi rice, and voila! My Scattered Sushi toppings are easy to prepare. Chirashi is a type of scattered sushi served in a bowl, so you need to use the typical seasoned sushi rice made from Japanese short-grain rice.</p>
<p>So that is going to wrap this up for this special food bamboo shoot and shrimp chirashi sushi recipe. Thanks so much for your time. I&rsquo;m sure that you will make this at home.
