In Japan, you can experience these hot pots in specialty restaurants or izakaya that serve up Stainless steel hot pot with divider: There are various styles of stainless steel hot pots available Hot pot/stew dishes use thinly sliced beef or pork for flavoring the broth, but some use seafood or chicken.</p>

<li>After turning off the heat, add the mizuna leaves. The cod and salmon fillets are fragile, so be careful. Transfer to individual bowls. This bowlful serves 1 person.</li>
<li>The ingredients absorb the soup, so you really don't need dipping sauce but you can eat tofu with ponzu sauce.</li>
<li>After eating the contents of the pot, make a zosui (rice cooked in hot pot soup) by adding quickly washed cooked rice, beaten eggs and mizuna leaves and cook through. This is very tasty too.</li>
