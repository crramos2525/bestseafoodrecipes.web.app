It&rsquo;s simple, it&rsquo;s quick, it tastes delicious. Parchment garlic butter with thyme salmon is something which I have loved my whole life. They are fine and they look fantastic.</p>
<p>To get started with this particular recipe, we have to prepare a few ingredients. You can cook parchment garlic butter with thyme salmon using 7 ingredients and 6 steps. Here is how you cook that.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-parchment-garlic-butter-with-thyme-salmon">The ingredients needed to make Parchment garlic butter with thyme salmon:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Make ready  1 potato sliced thinly approx 1 oz</li>
<li>Prepare  - tbl spoon of melted butter</li>
<li>Get  1-2 clove Garlic finely chopped more if you like</li>

<li>Take  6 oz Skinless salmon fillet</li>
<li>Make ready  Salt and pepper to taste</li>
<li>Get  Parchment paper or tin foil</li>
</ol>
<p>We make the marinade the day before and when we get home This garlic butter Salmon is a great weekend dish and perfect for those weekend gatherings. It's light, flavorful and wonderful for anyone who loves. I usually wrap two salmon fillets together in one &quot;parchment envelope&quot; You can wrap as many as will fit on your pan in one envelope (or one giant fillet with several spoons of herb butter) or you can wrap each fillet individually… whatever floats your boat. I actually usually use tinfoil because it's easier to.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="instructions-to-make-parchment-garlic-butter-with-thyme-salmon">Instructions to make Parchment garlic butter with thyme salmon:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Pre heat oven to 350 f(180 c)</li>
<li>Fold parchment paper in half, make sure you have enough parchment paper to fold and make a pocket for all the ingredients. The pocket should have enough room and not be tight</li>
<li>In a small bowl combine the garlic,butter and thyme. Spread the potato’s on one half of the parchment paper and pour over have of the butter mixture.</li>
<li>Lay the salmon over the potato’s and drizzle with the rest of the butter, season lightly with salt and pepper. I like to add a couple of slices of Lemmon on top of the salmon along with some sprigs of thyme (optional)</li>
<li>Fold the parchment paper over the salmon and clinch the edges starting at one end all the way round to form a sealed pocket</li>
<li>Place on a baking tray and put in the pre heated oven for approx 30min or until the internal temperature of the salmon reaches 145 f (63 c) serve and enjoy</li>
</ol>
<p>In a hot oven, melt butter in a skillet until it sizzles, add the salmon, flip, remove the skin, then allow to roast a few minutes more. Don't be afraid to play with herb and fat combinations: parsley, chervil or dill work well with butter; thyme, basil or marjoram. Basting salmon in a mixture of butter, garlic and thyme make this salmon utterly irresistable. Season salmon generously with salt and pepper. Next, pour oil into pan and place salmon skin-side down; adjust heat as necessary if bottom begins to brown too quickly.</p>
