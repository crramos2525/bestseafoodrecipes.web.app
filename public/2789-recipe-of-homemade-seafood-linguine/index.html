<p>To begin with this particular recipe, we must prepare a few ingredients. You can cook seafood linguine using 12 ingredients and 7 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-seafood-linguine">The ingredients needed to make Seafood Linguine:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Take 1 lb. Linguine pasta</li>
<li>Prepare 4 tbsp. Olive oil</li>
<li>Get 4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
<li>Get 10 mussels, cleaned and debearded</li>
<li>Prepare 10 clams, cleaned</li>
<li>Make ready 1/2 cup dry white wine (I think this needs to be 1 cup for more flavor)</li>
<li>Make ready 1 tomato, thinly sliced</li>
<li>Make ready 1 cup Whole peeled tomatoes,from a can</li>
<li>Prepare 10 Shrimp, 21/25 size</li>
<li>Prepare 1/2 cup Seafood broth (or 1/2 cup pasta water, that you cooked the pasta in.)</li>
<li>Prepare 2 tbsp. Chopped basil</li>
<li>Prepare 2 tbsp. Chopped Parsley</li>
</ol>

<script></script>
<h5 id="steps-to-make-seafood-linguine">Steps to make Seafood Linguine:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the linguine, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink</li>
<li>While the pasta is cooking, heat 2 tablespoon of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the garlic, mussels, clams and white wine. Cook for 2 minutes covered. (I didn’t use clams)</li>
<li>Stir in tomatoes, shrimp, seafood broth, remaining oil, and basil. Add pasta to the pan and cover with a lid on high heat. Cook until shrimp have turned pink and Finish with a remaining olive oil, parsley, and season to taste.</li>
<li>Note- I made everything to taste, and because I was feeding more than two people I added way more than what the recipe calls for. I didn’t have clams I had to substitute them for scallops, the store I was at didn’t have them. After cooking this if I made anymore changes I would use 1 cup of wine all together and use less pasta water 1/3 cup maybe, this was great but I think it needs more wine for flavor</li>
<li>Then again I used all frozen seafood and not fresh, and added some butter too. My mussels came in a garlic and butter sauce so that help out with the flavor of this dish..</li>
<li></li>
<li>This is so good I will be making this again everyone loved it my teen inhaled it lol my preteen’s loved the shrimp of course.A little something for everyone.</li>
</ol>
