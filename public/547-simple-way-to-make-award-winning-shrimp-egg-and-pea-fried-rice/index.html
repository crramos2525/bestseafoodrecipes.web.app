<ol>
<li>Get your rice going if making fresh. If using left over, leave it in the refrigerator, cold rice breaks up easier.</li>
<li>Frozen or fresh shrimp can be used. If frozen, thaw per package directions. If fresh, peel and devein the shrimp. I used frozen, peeled and cooked here. I hate cleaning shrimp!</li>

<li>Add your shrimp, pepper and garlic back in</li>
<li>Stir for about 3 minutes, until it is mixed well, and all is heated through. I also put another grind of black pepper in.</li>
