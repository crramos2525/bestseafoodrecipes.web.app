<ol>
<li>When buying fresh, it can be hit or miss if you don't have a favorite trusted place to buy, but there are some things to look for as you choose: For shrimp (often from frozen): Should be firm and clear from spotting. Buying whole will add extra flavoring to the broth.</li>
<li>For squid (often from frozen): Should be firm, in first stage of defrost, on ice. There is some prep before adding to soup.</li>
<li>For clams: Clams, get fresh when possible. If the clam &quot;spits&quot; at you, it's fresh.</li>
<li>This is an example of a dead clam:</li>
<li>For fish: Look at the eyes. You want clear.</li>
<li>If cloudy, he's been there a while:</li>
<li>Marinade for seafood: Put squid in bowl.</li>
<li>Prepare squid: Pull out head.</li>
<li>Cut of head tentacles and remove beak.</li>
<li>Pull out pen. (quill)</li>
<li>Clean out all internal flesh with your fingers or running under cold water.</li>
<li>Remove the outer skin (optional)</li>
<li>Slice into rings.</li>
<li>Discard rest.</li>
<li>Add to separate bowl to marinate with fish.</li>
<li>Cut fish into bite sized chunks and add to squid.</li>
<li>Sprinkle seafood lightly with a pinch of ground cumin, ground mustard and ground coriander and a dash of chili powder. Mix well with some olive oil, cover and put back in fridge until ready to use.</li>

<li>Prepare the vegetables.</li>
<li>Dice the onion.</li>
<li>Dice zucchini.</li>
<li>Dice peppers.</li>
<li>Dice hot peppers.</li>
<li>Jalapeño peppers vary in heat. For hot, look for lines on the pepper.</li>
<li>For milder heat, use chile manzano or &quot;apple pepper.&quot; You want a nice bright color all around.</li>
<li>Look for bright, shiny and firm, if browning, not fresh.</li>
<li>Mince the garlic.</li>
<li>In large pot, add 3 tbs extra virgin olive oil, sauté onion and peppers until onion is translucent, then add zucchini and the garlic continue stirring.</li>
