<ol>
<li>Here's my squid!</li>
<li>The suckers on fresh squid will stick to you. This isn't a trick!</li>
<li>Insert a finger (the index finger should work best) where the eyes are, and separate the part that's stuck together. Separate the body and guts as far as you can reach.</li>
<li>When the guts have been loosened as much as possible, insert two fingers this time and separate the stuck-on parts that are back.</li>
<li>Holding down the triangular parts (the fins), pull out the cartilage; it looks like a transparent bone.</li>
<li>If you have loosened things up properly in Steps 3 and 4, when you pull the legs and body in opposite directions the insides should come right out.</li>
<li>Pull the fins to peel off the skin. Pull it off in one go! Insert a finger between the skin and body wherever it's stuck, and the skin should come off easily.</li>
<li>Pull the skin from the top of the fins towards the legs, and it should come off cleanly. The fresher the squid, the easier the skin comes off!</li>
<li>Take the skin off. Don't worry if the body rips a bit.</li>

<li>Cut off the bottom of the body.</li>
<li>Make small &quot;hidden&quot; cuts on the inside of the cleaned body! Make shallow cuts that go about half way through the body. Use the tip of your knife!</li>

<li>To turn the squid into somen noodles, slice it very thinly using the tip of your knife. Cut in one smooth stroke from back to front.</li>
<li>Arrange the cut noodles on a plate using metal chopsticks to make it nice.</li>
<li>Arrange on a plate.</li>
<li>Divide the remaining legs and guts. Use in another dish.</li>
<li>Take out the ink sac. Peel it off carefully so you don't break it.</li>
<li>Wrap the guts and legs in foil and cook them, or use them in shio kara (salt-preserved squid). Use the squid ink for risotto or pasta.</li>
<li>I salted down the guts and left it overnight to use in shio kara.</li>

<p>He makes theories on why people are doing what they do and will gladly tell them if asked- or even ask to tell you them anyway. Although it is usally translated into English as squid, the ika used in sushi is more often cuttlefish as it has a softer taste.
