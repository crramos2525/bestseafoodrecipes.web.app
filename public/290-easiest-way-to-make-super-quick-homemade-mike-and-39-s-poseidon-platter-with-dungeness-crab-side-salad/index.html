<ol>
<li>Pictured is the bulk of what you'll need for 2.5 servings. If choosing to steam your own legs - steam with lemon, garlic and white wine. When you can smell your legs - they're done. The Dungeness Crab will take 7 to 8 minutes per pound if choosing to steam. More seafood was served but this was all my students could fit into frame.</li>
<li>Start your corn cobs. Add equal parts milk and water. Milk adds sweetness to corn. Add enough fluid to cover your corn. Also, add your butter. Bring to a boil and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes. Watch your pot as the milk can cause it foam up and overflow.</li>
<li>Make your marinade and coat all seafood generously with it. Not much is needed.</li>
<li>Scewer your Jumbo Shrimp, marinate and refrigerate. Also, add a few dashes of lemon pepper to your shrimp.</li>
<li>It's time to grill! Clean grill, spray with non stick spray and heat. Here you're only heating your King Crab Legs and Dungeness Crab. Try to keep your temp at 400° However, you'll be grilling your shrimp. Over direct heat, grill for 5 to 7 minutes turning occasionally until shrimp is pink on the outside and opaque on the inside..</li>
<li>Gently heat your garlic Kerrygold butter.</li>
<li>Plate seafood hot with lemon wedges to the side with plenty of napkins.</li>
<li>Since you have all of your butters out at room temperature, consider serving fresh, warm crispy breads. Also, consider a honey butter. It's a great contrast to the saltiness of your seafood and other butters. I've got a great honey butter recipe under my profile if interested. ☺</li>
<li>Pull your top shells from your Dungeness Crabs and clean. Boil for two minutes.</li>
<li>A pulled and cleaned top shell from crab pictured.</li>
<li>The inside of your cleaned shell pictured that's been boiled for 2 minutes. You do have the option of leaving what we call, &quot;The Mustard,&quot; within the shell but, I warn you - you'd better like the crazy taste of fishy if you do! 🐬</li>
<li>Create your crab salad by chopping your vegetables and adding your other chilled ingredients. See recipe above. Mix well.</li>
<li>Pack your shell with your craby chilled rich goodness! Garnish with fresh parsley, fresh ground black pepper and lemon wedges Enjoy!</li>
<li>Check this out. my students even bought their moms a special pink fragrant rose at the end of their meal. How stinking sweet was that?! I swear - so sweet I darned near got a cavity!</li>
