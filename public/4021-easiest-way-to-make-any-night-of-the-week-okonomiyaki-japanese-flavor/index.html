<p>Okonomiyaki recipe : savory Japanese cabbage pancakes with bacon, served with homemade okonomiyaki sauce and Japanese mayonnaise. Okonomiyaki, translated as &quot;grilled as you like&quot; is a savory Japanese cabbage pancake (or some might call it Japanese pizza) made with lots of. There are many Okonomiyaki-ya, or Japanese restaurants that serve this delicious pancake, where you can even make your own with tables that have built in grill Okonomiyaki is always topped with sauces and other garnish, and the flavour comes as much from what you add to the batter, as these. I serve it with Okonomiyaki sauce (brown sauce) and Japanese Mayo (it's like american mayo without sugar so you can substitute regular mayo no problem) You can also add some finely chopped up leek which really adds to the traditional flavor.</p>

<h5 id="instructions-to-make-okonomiyaki--japanese-flavor">Instructions to make Okonomiyaki ～ Japanese flavor:</h5>
<ol>
<li>In a large bowl, combine all Okonomiyaki batter ingredients together and mix well.</li>
<li>Put all IngredientsⅡinto the blow of mixed Okonomiyaki Batter, except pork, and Mix all until well-combined.</li>
<li>Put a bit oil in the household teppanyaki or a non-stick frying pan, heat oil on medium heat. spread the batter in a circle on the pan, and make its thickness about 1.5 to 2 cm.</li>
<li>Place sliced pork on top of Okonomiyaki and cook covered until the bottom side is golden brown, then flip it over. (If you can not make sure to flip it easy, then you could make it thin, and make 2 pieces of Okonomiyaki with this recipe or you can use a big plate to help for flipping</li>
<li>Flip it again when the other side is also nicely browned, and brush okonomiyaki sauce or yakisoba sauce on cooked Okonomiyaki, then add mayonnaise nicely, and put some Katsuobushi (dried bonito flakes) on top of mayonnaise, and then some shred laver.</li>
<li>Cut it into 4 and serving hot.</li>
<li>PS, if you don't have okonomiyaki sauce or yakisoba sauce, simply use oyster sauce instead.</li>
<li>Enjoy! ^_^</li>
</ol>
<p>I serve it with Okonomiyaki sauce (brown sauce) and. Once you've got a few Japanese staples in your pantry (all of which have a shelf life of forever), making it at home is cheap, quick Okonomi means &quot;how you want it,&quot; and an okonomiyaki is one of the world's most infinitely adaptable dishes. Ginger mixed directly into the batter provides extra flavor. I was hesitant to purchase these because I wasn't sure of the flavor. After opening my first bag, my taste buds find these to be a wonderful curious flavor, which in my mind is a mix of teriyaki, toned.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s going to wrap it up for this special food okonomiyaki ～ japanese flavor recipe. Thanks so much for your time. I am sure you will make this at home. There&rsquo;s gonna be more interesting food at home recipes coming up. Remember to save this page in your browser, and share it to your family, friends and colleague. Thank you for reading.
