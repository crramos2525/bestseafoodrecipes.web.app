<p>Hey everyone, it is Louise, welcome to my recipe site. Today, we&rsquo;re going to make a special dish, eggs benedict. It is one of my favorites. For mine, I am going to make it a bit unique. This will be really delicious.</p>

<p>To get started with this recipe, we have to first prepare a few components. You can cook eggs benedict using 11 ingredients and 9 steps. Here is how you cook it.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-eggs-benedict">The ingredients needed to make Eggs Benedict:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Get  eggs, room temperature</li>
<li>Get  white vinegar</li>
<li>Make ready  English muffins - Woolworths</li>
<li>Prepare  smoked ham or smoked Salmon</li>
<li>Take  baby spinach</li>
<li>Make ready  For hollandaise sauce</li>
<li>Make ready  egg yolks</li>
<li>Take  lemon juice</li>
<li>Take  salt</li>
<li>Take  cayenne pepper (optional)</li>
<li>Make ready  butter (unsalted, if using salted butter skip adding salt)</li>
</ol>

<script></script>
<h5 id="steps-to-make-eggs-benedict">Steps to make Eggs Benedict:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Make the hollandaise sauce. Melt the butter: Melt the butter slowly in a small pot. Try not to let it boil—you want the moisture in the butter to remain there and not steam away.</li>
<li>Blend egg yolks, lemon juice, salt, until lightened in color: Add the egg yolks, lemon juice, salt and cayenne (if using) into your blender. Blend the egg yolk mixture at a medium to medium high speed until it lightens in color, about 20-30 seconds. - The friction generated by the blender blades will heat the yolks a bit. The blending action will also introduce a little air into them, making your hollandaise a bit lighter.</li>
<li>Lower blender setting, slowly drizzle in melted butter: Once the yolks have lightened in color, turn the blender down to its lowest setting (if you only have one speed on your blender it will still work), and drizzle in the hot melted butter slowly, while the blender is going. - Continue to blend for another couple seconds after the butter is all incorporated.</li>
<li>Adjust salt and lemon juice to taste: Turn off the blender and taste the sauce. It should be buttery, lemony and just lightly salty. If it is not salty or lemony enough, you can add a little lemon juice or salt to taste. - If you want a thinner consistency, add a little warm water. Pulse briefly to incorporate the ingredients one more time. - Store until needed in a warm spot, like on or next to the stovetop. Use within an hour or so.</li>
<li>Bring poaching water to a simmer: bring a large saucepan two-thirds-filled with water to a boil, then add the vinegar. Bring the water to a boil again, then lower the heat to a bare simmer.</li>
<li>Strain thin whites with a fine mesh sieve: Place the raw egg into a fine mesh sieve over a bowl. The very thin egg whites will drain out through the sieve. Gently add to hot water: Then gently ease the raw egg into your pot of simmering hot water.</li>
<li>Toast English muffins: As soon as all the eggs are in the poaching water, begin toasting your English muffins. If you can’t get all the muffins toasted by the time the eggs are ready, gently remove the eggs from the poaching water and set in a bowl. Also add the spinach to a shallow pan with 2 tbsp of water and cook soft (wilted). Dry the spinach by putting it on rolling towel.</li>
<li>Remove eggs with slotted spoon: Gently lift the poached eggs out of the pan with a slotted spoon and place on a plate to serve.</li>
<li>Assemble your Eggs Benedict: To assemble, butter one side of an English muffin. Add wilted spinach. Top with each toasted side with a slice of smoked ham or salmon. - Put a poached egg on top of each one, then pour some hollandaise over. Sprinkle some cayenne over it all and serve at once.</li>
