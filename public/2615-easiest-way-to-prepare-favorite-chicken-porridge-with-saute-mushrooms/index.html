<ol>

<li>Place the porridge in bowls. Garnish with sauté mushrooms, fried wonton wrappers, and green onions. Serve warm. Yum 😋</li>
</ol>
<p>Just remember shrimp only needs a few minutes to cook. I saute mine in a little olive oil and garlic. Traditionally, chicken porridge is made with chicken stock and pulled chicken meat. Often, it's made with leftover chicken soup, such as dak Often, I also make porridge with leftover roasted chicken.
