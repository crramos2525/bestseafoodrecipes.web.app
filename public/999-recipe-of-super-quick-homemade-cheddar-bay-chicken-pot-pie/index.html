<p>Hey everyone, I hope you are having an incredible day today. Today, I will show you a way to prepare a distinctive dish, cheddar bay chicken pot pie. One of my favorites food recipes. This time, I am going to make it a bit tasty. This will be really delicious.</p>
<p>Cheddar bay chicken pot pie is one of the most popular of current trending meals on earth. It is appreciated by millions every day. It is simple, it is quick, it tastes yummy. Cheddar bay chicken pot pie is something that I have loved my whole life. They&rsquo;re nice and they look wonderful.</p>
<p>Whisk in the milk until smooth, then add the chicken, peas and carrots, pearl onions, potato, salt, and pepper. Stir until everything is well coated, then continue to cook until the filling is bubbling and the liquid has. Homemade Biscuits replace the traditional pastry crust in Chicken Pot Pie with Bacon-and-Cheddar Biscuits.</p>
<p>To get started with this particular recipe, we have to prepare a few components. You can cook cheddar bay chicken pot pie using 9 ingredients and 7 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-cheddar-bay-chicken-pot-pie">The ingredients needed to make Cheddar bay chicken pot pie:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Prepare  chicken breasts</li>
<li>Take  russet potatoes</li>
<li>Get  stalks celery</li>
<li>Make ready  onion, chopped</li>
<li>Prepare  carrots, sliced</li>
<li>Make ready  cream of chicken soup. I used Campbell's condensed.</li>
<li>Take  red lobsters' cheddar bay biscuit mix. One package will make 10 biscuits. Make these according to package directions.</li>
<li>Prepare  Pillsbury crescent rolls</li>
<li>Prepare  crushed garlic</li>
</ol>
<p>When you had a long day at work, you're tempted to make the filling and skip the whole pie part altogether. The hearty dish of tender vegetables and protein tossed in gravy and topped with biscuits or pie crust is the ultimate winter comfort food. While there's nothing wrong with a pot pie made from frozen mixed veggies, a store-bought crust, and pulled rotisserie chicken, we. It's hard to imagine a more comforting combination than a savory chicken pot pie filling topped with cheesy biscuits.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="steps-to-make-cheddar-bay-chicken-pot-pie">Steps to make Cheddar bay chicken pot pie:</h5>
<ol>
<li>In 11x8 glass baking dish, lay the crescent rolls (in a whole sheet) across the bottom and slightly up the sides. You might want to use pan coating but isn't necessary since to bake the rolls requires no coating on the pan in original instructions. I did use a little. Just in case.</li>
<li>Cut the chicken breast into bite sized pieces and cook in a pan with a little salt and pepper and a couple cloves of crushed garlic.</li>
<li>When the chicken is almost done add the vegetables. Cut the vegetables into bite sized pieces as well. While this is cooking mix the biscuits. Also in another bowl take the soup and mix it with 3/4 can of milk.</li>
<li>Cook veg with the chicken for about 15 minutes or until the carrots are tender-crisp. Add the soup mixture to the chicken/veg.</li>
<li>Should be about like this</li>
<li>Take the cheddar bay biscuit mix you made and, I used my fingers, add it to the top. Like this</li>
<li>Bake at 400Â° for about 25-30 minutes. Check to make sure the biscuit top is done. When you remove it from the oven, take the garlic butter (from the cheddar bay biscuit mix) you have and brush it on top.</li>
</ol>
<p>Butternut squash replaces the usual potatoes for a nice hit of color and sweetness. Note: Using precooked rotisserie chicken meat saves valuable prep time. At Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen, we pinch the edges of every one of our Homemade Chicken Pot Pies. (Of our Homemade Chicken Pot Pies, that is.) You'd think the best part of this dish would be the scratch-made cream sauce, but there's just something about your spoon breaking through a crispy. All the goodness of a creamy, homemade chicken pot pie topped with those addicting Red Lobster biscuits! Stir in chicken mixture and broth.</p>
