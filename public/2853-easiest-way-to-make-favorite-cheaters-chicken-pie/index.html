<p>Hello everybody, I hope you&rsquo;re having an incredible day today. Today, we&rsquo;re going to make a distinctive dish, cheaters chicken pie. One of my favorites. This time, I will make it a little bit tasty. This is gonna smell and look delicious.</p>
<p>Cheaters Chicken Pie is one of the most popular of recent trending meals in the world. It is enjoyed by millions every day. It is easy, it is fast, it tastes yummy. They are fine and they look wonderful. Cheaters Chicken Pie is something which I have loved my whole life.</p>
<p>Have also tried with a can of diced potatoes frozen peas pearl onions and mushrooms to good effect. StoneGable Cheater's Chicken Pot Pies Mash the potatoes with a mixer or by hand, adding butter or plain yogurt and the remaining cream of chicken soup. If potatoes are too stiff, add milk, but you don't want them to be runny.</p>
<p>To get started with this particular recipe, we must prepare a few components. You can have cheaters chicken pie using 13 ingredients and 3 steps. Here is how you cook it.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-cheaters-chicken-pie">The ingredients needed to make Cheaters Chicken Pie:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Make ready 1 1/2 lb chicken breast, boneless/skinless *see note</li>
<li>Prepare 1 small yellow onion, cut in 1/4ths</li>
<li>Get 1 9&quot; deep dish pie shell, uncooked</li>
<li>Make ready 1 prepared pie dough</li>
<li>Prepare 5 carrots, peeled and cut in 1&quot; pieces</li>
<li>Get 1 1/2 cup Sautéed quartered mushrooms</li>
<li>Get 15 oz can of sliced new potatoes</li>
<li>Prepare 1 cup frozen peas</li>
<li>Prepare 15 1/2 oz can herb roasted garlic chicken soup (condensed)</li>
<li>Take 15 1/2 oz can cream of celery soup (condensed)</li>
<li>Take 1 egg</li>
<li>Take 2 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
<li>Prepare 1 salt and pepper to taste</li>
</ol>
<p>Cut biscuits into fourths and arrange over the top of casserole. What is Chicken Pot Pie made of? Most chicken pot pie is made with a combination of shredded chicken, cooked vegetables, a creamy sauce, and some pie crust. My 'cheater' version replaces the pie crust with store-bought biscuit-dough instead.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="steps-to-make-cheaters-chicken-pie">Steps to make Cheaters Chicken Pie:</h5>
<ol>
<li>in a 4 quart crackpot,  place chicken breasts, carrots, onion,  seasonings (salt, pepper and anything else you like) and crushed garlic cloves. fill with enough water to cover chicken. cook on low for 6 to 8 hours or on low for 4 hours. Once done remove chicken and carrots and set aside. strain stock and reserve.</li>
<li>Quarter and sauté the mushrooms in butter or olive oil over medium heat until lightly browned, approx 7 minutes.  mix soups and fill one can with reserved stock and combine until smooth.  Once the chicken is cool enough to handle, cut in to bite sized pieces or shred. add chicken,  carrots,  peas, sautéed mushrooms, drained potatoes and seasonings to soup mixture and stir to thoroughly combine.  place chicken mixture in unbaked pie shell then cover with uncooked pastry sheet. make sure to crimp the edges together well so there are no leaks.  in a small bowl beat egg and brush over the entire top of pastry. cut three or four small slits into the top to release the steam. bake in a preheated 400° oven for approximately 45 minutes until golden brown. watch the edges of the crust so they don't burn. once baked,  let stand at least 5 minutes before cutting.</li>
<li>*you can also roast the chicken in a 400°oven and just boil the carrots if you'd rather not use the crackpot method.</li>
</ol>
<p>In a large oven-safe skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook until it becomes soft and translucent, three minutes. Assemble, fill and bake pie as directed in recipe. To Freeze Chicken Filling: prepare as directed in recipe. The Honey Stung Fried Chicken sandwich is prepared using Chester's specially marinated, double-breaded breast fillet and tossed in Frank's RedHot® Stingin' Honey Garlic™ sauce.</p>
