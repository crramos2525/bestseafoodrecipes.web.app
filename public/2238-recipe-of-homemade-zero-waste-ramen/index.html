<p>To get started with this recipe, we have to prepare a few components. You can have zero waste ramen using 16 ingredients and 8 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.</p>

<script></script>

<h5 id="instructions-to-make-zero-waste-ramen">Instructions to make Zero Waste Ramen:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Put veggie scraps in a large heavy pot and cover with water. Add around 2 tsp of salt, and bring to a boil. Boil them in high heat for about an hour tops.</li>
<li>Remove the pot from the fire and strain the veggie scraps, reserving the resulting broth. It will be very bland. Don't worry, you can adjust the seasoning later.</li>
<li>In a sauce pan mix the chicken or dashi stock with the soy sauce, the mirin, sake, sugar, rice vinegar, smashed garlic and ginger, and scallion. Stir and bring to a simmer. Cook on low heat until the mixture has reduced to about 1/2 cup of liquid. Be careful not to let the soy sauce burn. This will be the Tare, and will adjust the seasoning of the ramen.</li>
<li>Boil two eggs, straight from the fridge, for 6 minutes. Start counting once the water starts boiling. The yolk should come up soft, or at least, perfectly yellow with no grayish rim.</li>
<li>Add salt and pepper to both chicken thighs. In a skillet, cook the thighs skin side down first, until crispy and golden. Then flip and repeat. Set aside to rest, then cut each thigh into bite size strips.</li>
<li>Cook the ramen noodles as instructed in the package. If you can't find any, use fresh spaghetti and replace the salt in the water with baking soda (sodium bicarbonate). Around 2 tsp should do.</li>
<li>Fold the nori sheet four times and cut it into little rectangles.</li>
<li>Finally, assemble the ramen: place 3 tbsp of tare in the bottom of the bowl, then add the noodles, followed by 4 ladlefuls of veggie broth. Place the toppings on top (the chicken thigh, and the egg sliced in half, and 4 nori sheets). I also added a shitake mushroom, a few slices of carrot, and corn. Be creative, and add any topping you want. Some flavoured oil can also add a great finishing touch (chilli oil, sesame oil, garlic oil, etc).</li>
</ol>
<p>We can all do our part for the planet. The hard truth is, probably not.</p>
