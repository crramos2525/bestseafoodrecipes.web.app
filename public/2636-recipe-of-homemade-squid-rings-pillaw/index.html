  <meta name="description" content="Squid rings pillaw
Hello everybody, hope you are having an incredible day today. Today, I’m gonna show you how to prepare a special dish, squid rings pillaw. One of my favorites. For mine, I’m gonna make it a bit tasty. This is gonna smell and look delicious.
This pillow can come with any color squid you’d like. Squid rings consist of thin slices of the squid’s body. Try marinating cooked squid rings in the refrigerator for at least two hours, then serving them on salad greens or cooked grains like couscous.">

<li>Fry potatoes and once they change color toss around with slotted spoon so the cook evenly,until reddish brown.remove on cleanewspaper or paper towl&hellip;Now prep the corri,rince in collander and chop</li>
<li>Now take some of the tomato sauce from container it was frozen in(used a knife to do thus,see pic) and place in a bowl,or in a cooking pan straight away,add choped corriander,grate the beetroot,</li>
<li>Mean while you can also prep the rice at this stage:so 3 cups of basmati rice in a large enof bowl to add about 1 and 3/4 cups of water to soak for half an hour.after which drain(about a cup and a quatr water was drained and discarded,(this was good way for rincing out instead of ringing first becoz we may just be waiting water like that,unless realy needed to rince at beginning before soaking).at the end</li>
<li>Now add all in pan, and then,breakdown the tomato sauce chunks and cook this in medium heat until combined,now add squid(I mistake added squid abit late,and so didn't cook well enof.).include the spices too.</li>
<li>Cook bit more for squid to cook,make sure squid is all coverd with sauce..simmer for about 5 mins.otherwise If not add about a quatr cup(be careful not add alot of water,),in order for squid rings to cook</li>
<li>Add about 2 tablespoon nice yogart.and reduce heat to simmer few mins.set aside to use later</li>
<li>Back to the rice!(see step 8).has been enof time for soaking the rice.now drain out water,and cook it(pic shows draining and how to see what much water is left so can drain more(can use large sieve or cover with lid and pour gently into sink (try not to mwaga/spil the rice over!</li>
<li>Place in large enof cooking pot and add spices,add some oil.added 3 and half cups of water.cover and cook on low mediu heat for few mins and open lid, turn with wooden spoon and cook bit further until cooked</li>
<li>Now took some rice out (about 1/2 of amount) in another container,then aded cooked the sauce..stir in and leave to simmer on lowest heat for about 5 to 10 mins ensuring it does not stick at base of pan by turning it from base with wooden spoon..</li>
<li>Now start layering,so add the plain at base,then the mixed at top and maybe plain again then now mix all together to get nice end mixture inshaallah(note that the colour of sauce changes from a sheepish purple colour to a deep red orange colir(due to beet root changes,see pic)compare the sauce at beginning just after cooking it and at end while adding to rice..MashaAllah another amazing chemicals proces from Allah</li>
<li>Bismillah enjoy</li>
