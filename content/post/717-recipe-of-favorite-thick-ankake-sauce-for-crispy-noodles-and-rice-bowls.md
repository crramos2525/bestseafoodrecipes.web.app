- "1 Pork shrimp squid frozen seafood mix etc Whatever you have on hand or just use veggies"
- "1 Chinese cabbage cabbage carrot onion Chinese chives etc  whatever you have in your fridge"
- "250 ml A Water"
- "1/2 heaping teaspoon A Weipa"
- "1/5 to 2 teaspoons A Soy sauce"
- "1/2 tsp A Sake"
- "1/2 tsp A Oyster sauce"
- "1/2 tsp A Mirin"
- "1 just 1 dash bit A Grated garlic"
- "1 B Salt and pepper"
- "1 1/2 to 2 tablespoons  Katakuriko"
- "1 Sesame oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Cut up the meat and/or seafood into bite sized pieces, sprinkle with about 2 tablespoons of sake and leave for a while (while you&#39;re doing Steps 2 to 6)."
- "Cut up the vegetables so that they&#39;ll cook through fast. I used 4 leaves of Chinese cabbage, 1/4 a large onion and 2 handfuls of bean sprouts."
- "Put all the A. ingredients into a pan and heat. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Heat until just before it comes to a boil. The sauce should taste just a bit too salty at this stage, and it will be just right later when you add the other ingredients."
- "I use Weipa soup stock base, but if you don&#39;t have this, use another chicken soup stock base and make 250 ml of soup from it."
- "Dissolve the katakuriko in 4 to 5 tablespoons of the Step 4 soup."
- "If you&#39;re serving this over rice, put the rice in a serving bowl and skip ahead to Step 11."
- "If you&#39;re making crispy fried noodles... Ppen up one side of a bag of semi-cooked yakisoba noodles, and microwave for 40 to 50 seconds at 600W."
- "Heat up a generous amount of oil (not listed) in a frying pan over high heat. (I use vegetable oil)."
- "Put the heated noodles in the hot oil, and lightly untangle with chopsticks after a few seconds. Make a flat circle of noodle like a pancake."
- "Press down on the noodles occasionally and keep frying until they&#39;re as browned as you want them to be. Flip over and brown the other side. Drain and put on a plate."
- "Put some sesame oil in a frying pan or wok over high heat. Add the Step 1 ingredients, season with salt and pepper and stir fry."
- "When the Step 11 ingredients are about 80% cooked, add the Step 2 vegetables, starting with the ones that take longer to cook. Season with salt and pepper and stir fry, taking care not to let it burn, until the vegetables are wilted."
- "Add the Step 3 sauce all at once. 30 seconds after it comes to a boil, add the Step 5 katakuriko dissolved in soup and mix with your ladle so that the sauce doesn&#39;t clump."
- "When the sauce has thickened, pour the contents of the pan on top of the rice or noodles and it&#39;s done. (The quail egg in the photo was this color from the start.)"
- "I love the thick, creamy sauce mixed with rather hard, crispy fried noodles."
- "Ankake sauce always gets more watery as you eat it, right? So I like to make it rather thick to start with, whether it&#39;s over rice or on noodles."
- "My family prefers a lot of rice and a lot of vegetables, so this recipe is for just 1 serving. Please make it with your preferred amount of vegetables and sauce."
- "You can even enjoy pre-fried noodles with a thick ankake sauce. Or try a slightly loose ankake sauce with the burnt bits of rice on the bottom of the pot when you cook rice... try experimenting with it yourself."
