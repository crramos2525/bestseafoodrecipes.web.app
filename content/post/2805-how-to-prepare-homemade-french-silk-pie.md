Hello everybody, it's me again, Dan, welcome to my recipe page. Today, we're going to prepare a special dish, french silk pie. It is one of my favorites. This time, I'm gonna make it a little bit tasty. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

French silk pie is one of the most favored of recent trending meals in the world. It is enjoyed by millions every day. It is easy, it's fast, it tastes delicious. They're fine and they look fantastic. French silk pie is something which I've loved my whole life.

Repackage and refrigerate one half for another use. Delicious, creamy, and decadent French silk pie! This recipe is unique since it requires the eggs to be cooked rather than a traditional French silk pie recipe that uses raw eggs.


To get started with this particular recipe, we must prepare a few ingredients. You can cook french silk pie using 8 ingredients and 10 steps. Here is how you cook it.

##### The ingredients needed to make French silk pie:

1. Take 1 deep dish pie shell
1. Get 3/4 cup granulated sugar
1. Get 1/2 cup real butter, melted
1. Make ready 2 squares Nestlé unsweetened bakers chocolate, melted
1. Make ready 1 tsp vanilla extract
1. Make ready 2 eggs, beaten well
1. Get 1 Cool whip
1. Get 1 chocolate bar...Hershey, etc.


The first recipe for French silk pie is incomplete, that is why there is not enough filling for a full pie. French Silk Pie features an Oreo cookie crust, rich and creamy chocolate filling, and is topped with homemade whipped cream and chocolate shavings! This French silk pie, however, is served in a traditional pie crust and has a much richer, smoother filling. (Truthfully though… you can&#39;t go wrong with either chocolate pie!) Use Heavy Cream Again for Whipped Cream Topping. You need heavy cream for the filling AND the whipped cream garnish on top.
