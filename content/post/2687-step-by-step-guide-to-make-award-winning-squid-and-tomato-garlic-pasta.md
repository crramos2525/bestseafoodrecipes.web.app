Cut the steamed shrimp into chunks, then add them, plus the steamed squid, to the sauce; stir well. Bright red tomatos are peeled and chopped and cooked very briefly with tomato paste and sauteed garlic to make a fresh and colorful sauce for hot pasta. Stir in fresh basil just before combining the sauce with the pasta, then top with Parmesan cheese. I have always been emphatically anti-tomato when it comes to seafood sauces, liking my spaghetti alle vongole and any similarly conceived dish strictly in bianco. I don&#39;t renounce my previous preferences, but find I am now an enthusiastic consumer of the more southerly and less elegant red sauces, too.
