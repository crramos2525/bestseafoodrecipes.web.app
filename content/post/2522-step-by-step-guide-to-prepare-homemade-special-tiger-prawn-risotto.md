recipeinstructions:
- "Thaw prawns completely. Remove heads by twisting them off, drop them into a waiting large saucepan. Remove shells by putting fingers in the gap between the two sets of legs and pulling them off. Drop the shells in with the heads, into the pot."
- "Using a sharp knife, make a shallow cut into the back of the prawns, and remove the string- like intestine, discard this. Put peeled prawns to one side."
- "Slice and dice 1 Onion and add to the stock-pot. Peel and dice 2 small Carrots, add these to the pot. Put in 2-3 teaspoons of Black Peppercorns, and some Rock Salt."
