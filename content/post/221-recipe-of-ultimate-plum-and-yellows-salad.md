Juicy, ripe plums and heirloom tomatoes are a natural pair in this salad from chef Norberto Piattoni of Mettā in Brooklyn. Shaved persimmon and sesame seeds add texture, while shiso and purslane. The plums absorb the spicy flavor from the hot peppers giving this salsa a light, smoky-sweet flavor.

We&#39;re going to be the bearers of bad news up front: We don&#39;t have the recipe for this beautiful plum cake. (It&#39;s from Flickr and the comments aren&#39;t in English, unfortunately.) But it served as inspiration for finding a bunch of recipes to use up the bounty of yellow plums we got in our CSA this week…Our plums are small and sweet with a thinner, less tart skin than larger purple plums. Perfect summer salad, took less than five minutes to make. Quite good, rather like the dessert often called &#34;French apple pie&#34;, just fruit with a light cake-like top. Although it sounds pretty fancy, the salad is actually incredibly simple (just check out that short ingredient list!). Plum Salad with Black Pepper and Parmesan.
