Quizás para los que estén más acostumbrados a la otra receta les resultará raro esta receta de carbonara sin nata pero la primera carbonara que probé fue ésta y para mi es la salsa clásica aunque puedes encontrar muchas variantes (como usar el huevo entero o añadirle nata pero no cebolla). One thing that I liked about this Bacon and Mushroom Carbonara (aside from its delicious taste) is its ease of preparation. Add bacon and cook in medium heat until the bacon fat gets extracted.
