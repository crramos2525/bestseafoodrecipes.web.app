One of the most representative dishes of Korean cuisine is sundubu jjigae (순두부 찌개), halfway between a thick soup and a juicy tofu stew.

In Korean cuisine, a jjigae is a simmered or braised dish. In Korean, sundubu means &#39;tofu&#39; but a variety of soft, fresh, undrained, unpressed tofu, commonly known as silky tofu or soft tofu. The rainy weather these days make me crave for Sundubu Jjigae 순두부찌개 or Korean Soft Tofu Stew so much. The popular Korean dish consist of soft tofu submerged in a deep-red spicy stew in a hot-piping bowl with ingredients such as seafood, sometimes meat, mushrooms, onions, and vegetables. The Korean stew (jjigae, 찌개) made with sundubu (or soondubu, 순두부) is enormously popular both in and outside Korea.
