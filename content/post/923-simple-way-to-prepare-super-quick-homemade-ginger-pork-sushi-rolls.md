recipeinstructions:
- "Cook and mix the sushi rice and let it cool down. Mix the sesame seeds."
- "Marinate the sliced pork in soy sauce, mirin, sake and ginger. (Thinly sliced pork is easier to use for the roll filling than thicker pork slabs used for ginger pork.) Remove the meat from the marinade after a while, and fry in a small amount of oil. Add the marinade too and cook thoroughly."
- "Begin making the rolls when the meat has cooled down. Leave the sauce in the pan. Line a sushi rolling mat (makisu) with plastic wrap, and spread the sushi rice very thinly and evenly (to about the size of the nori seaweed sheet). Put the nori seaweed sheet on top of the rice."
- "Spread lettuce leaves on top of the nori, and then lay more lettuce leaves, mayonnaise (2 fat lines) and the cooked ginger pork (drained) on the center."
- "Wrap up the roll tightly, starting with the edge the nearest you."
- "When it&#39;s rolled, cut with a moistened knife into slices of the size you prefer. (If the knife is dry the rice gets stuck, so moisten it every time you cut.)"
- "Arrange on a serving plate. Drizzle the sauce from the pan over the sushi rolls slices, in a spiral pattern. Done."
- "I had a Japanese food party at home. I uploaded recipes for some of the other items too."
