Drain the pasta and mix it with the garlic, lemon oil, tuna, olives and capers while still warm. Sprinkle the basil over, season with salt and freshly ground pepper and serve immediately. I used spaghetti squash and I did not have parsley so I used Thyme and I used Panko crumbs---It was really good! love lemon, love olives, love tuna - I use these ingredients a lot. So I was very surprised that I did NOT love this, in the least! not sure why, just did not like the taste of these flavors combined. The sharpness of lemon, the heat of chilli, the sprightliness of spring onions and the tender pepperiness of rocket, combine beautifully with the oily tuna.
