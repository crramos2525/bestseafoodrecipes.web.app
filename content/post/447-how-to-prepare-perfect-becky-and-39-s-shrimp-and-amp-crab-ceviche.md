For a spicier finish to Spicy Coconut Shrimp Soup, top with minced Thai chile pepper. Blackened Shrimp is mouth-watering, succulent shrimp coated with delicious blackened seasoning bursting with cajun flavor. What we have going on here is delicious spice-loaded shrimp tucked in between smashed avocado and a cabbage slaw that is heavy with a homemade creamy lime sauce. This cajun blackened shrimp recipe is one of the best and my absolute favorite ways to cook shrimp. The spice mixture sticks to the shrimp and gives it a crusty outside that is loaded with flavor.
