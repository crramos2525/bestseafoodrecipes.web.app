recipeinstructions:
- "&lt;&lt;Prep Work&gt;&gt; Cook rice with a little less water than usual. Add vinegar to the piping hot rice, and mix with a spatula in a cutting motion."
- "Mix the ★ ingredients together in a bowl, and make a fried omelet. (1 egg is barely enough so make it with 2 eggs). Let the fried omelet cool, cut into 1 cm thick ribbons, and set aside 2."
- "Cut a cucumber lengthwise into fourths and then cut in half again. (Cut them into eighths). Drain the oil from a can of tuna, and mix together with mayonnaise (the photo shows the ingredients for 1 roll)."
- "Wrapping: Place the seaweed rough-side down on a bamboo sushi mat. Leave about 1.5 cm of seaweed at the end (the overlap), and spread out the sushi rice (it&#39;s better to thinly spread out the rice until you get used to making these). Make a small dent towards the front end of the sushi rice for the tuna."
- "Sprinkle with sesame seeds to taste before rolling the ingredients. Spread the tuna in the indented sushi rice. Lay imitation crab meat (3 sticks), the fried egg, and cucumber on top of the tuna. In my case, since I press down on the ingredients with my middle finger when rolling, I think it&#39;s easier to roll up if you place the hard cucumber at the back."
- "Pick up the front end of the sushi mat, and roll while wrapping in the ingredients. In my case, I use both of my thumbs and index fingers to pick up the sushi mat, and press down on the ingredients with my middle fingers so that they will not fall out when rolling."
- "After you have rolled up the ingredients, squeeze down hard for about 5 seconds to pack them in. After that, wet the overlap piece in water, and roll it up the rest of the way. (Make sure that there is no rice stuck to the overlap piece. It will come apart easily if there is rice stuck to it)."
- "In order to make the seaweed firmly stick together, face the overlap piece towards the bottom, and let sit for a while. You don&#39;t have to leave it wrapped up in the sushi mat. Roll up 1 more in the same manner."
- "Cutting: Cut it up into smaller pieces for the last step. Make sure to check the wrapping direction of the seaweed! If you face it towards you as shown above in the photo after wrapping and then cut, you will be able to cut it cleanly without tearing the seaweed."
- "Wet the knife in water. Slice by moving the knife in a saw-like motion. If you press down while cutting, then the sushi rolls will fall apart, so be gentle."
- "For cutting cleanly:  Fold a paper towel (or a cloth) into fourths, and soak in water. If you wipe the knife with the towel every 1-2 cuts, then the cuts will become cleaner ."
