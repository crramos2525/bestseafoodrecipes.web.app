Vietnamese Caramelized Shrimp, or Tom Rim, is a quick and easy side dish in a traditional Vietnamese home-cooked meal. It&#39;s a very simple dish of sweet and savory shrimp that goes wonderfully with steamed white rice. You can choose to cook this dish with a bit of sauce or vaporize the sauce completely to allow the caramelization to really adhere to the shrimp. I prefer the latter as I think it.
