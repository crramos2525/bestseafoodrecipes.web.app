- "Season chicken pieces and chicken sausage well with garlic powder, garlic salt, garlic pepper, minced garlic, season salt or other favorite seasoning. Pan sear meat for 7-10 minutes in a lightly oiled frying pan. Remove from the pan and place seared meat in a very large pot."
- "Cover the chicken pieces and chicken sausage with water. Use just enough water to cover the meat and then turn the burner on medium heat. Once the water begins to boil add the bouillon cubes to the water and stir the water until the cubes dissolve. Turn the burner to low heat to allow it to simmer."
