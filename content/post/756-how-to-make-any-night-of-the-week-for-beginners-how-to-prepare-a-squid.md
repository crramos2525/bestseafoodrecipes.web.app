- "1 Squid"
recipeinstructions:
- "I bought a surume squid (called a &#34;ma-ika&#34; in some regions). This is a defrosted one. If you are going to eat the squid raw, buy a sashimi-ready one."
- "Take the guts out of the squid. Push your fingers into the squid body and pry apart the insides from the backbone and cartilage."
- "When you can&#39;t push your fingers in any further...."
- "....hold onto a fin with one hand and the arms with the other hand, and pull the arms with intestines attached. If they don&#39;t come off in one go, push your fingers in again and twist and pry the intestines out."
- "Did you separate the body from the arms and guts? Cut the guts off from arms."
- "Cut the arms off right under the eyeballs. Don&#39;t cut through the eyes or they&#39;ll splatter! If you&#39;re good at this already, do it your way."
- "I don&#39;t like squid guts so I throw them out. If you do like the guts, I recommend grilling them wrapped in foil. (Fresh guts only.)"
- "You&#39;ll find the beak near the end of the arms, so push it out with your fingers. It&#39;s hard so be careful. It&#39;s rather slimy around it."
- "This looks just like squid arms that are sold pre-cleaned. But you still have some work to do. If you stroke the arms you&#39;ll feel some hard things on the suckers. The fresher the squid, the harder those things are."
- "Use your thumbnail to scrape the hard things off the arms, starting from the base. A lot of translucent round things will fall out. These don&#39;t have a nice texture, so take them off diligently."
- "The body is next. Wash the cavity until it&#39;s clean, and remove any bits of guts still stuck to it. Take the cartilage out, too (the backbone?)"
- "If you are using the squid for simmered dishes or you&#39;re grilling them you can use the squid parts at this stage! Good work!"
- "To use the squid for sashimi or tempura, you have a bit more work to do. The arms are now done."
- "Place the squid body on a cutting board with the fin side facing up. Cut through the body along where the fin is attached, and open it up to form one large flat piece."
- "If you think you might cut through the other side of the body, fold the squid in half, insert your knife in the cavity, and slice open."
- "Here! It&#39;s been opened up neatly."
- "Pull the fins off the body slowly so that you don&#39;t tear the body."
- "Remove any skin that&#39;s remaining with paper towels by grabbing an edge and peeling it off. You can do this with your bare hands too, but it&#39;s slippery."
- "When the skin has been removed, the squid is now ready to use as sashimi! Slice it as thinly as you like to use as ika-somen (thin squid &#39;noodles&#39;)or squid sashimi."
- "Freeze the fins and arms, and defrost them in water to use in kakiage (tempura made with chopped up bits) or okonimiyaki anytime you want."
- "Lastly, here&#39;s how to prep the squid for tempura! If you&#39;re just going to chop it up and use it for tempura fritters, just follow up to Step 19! If you are deep frying it in larger pieces, read on."
- "There&#39;s a thin membrane on the inside of the body too. Score it very lightly in a crisscross pattern with your knife."
- "If there are any air bubbles left between the body and the skin, the oil may splatter, which is dangerous. Remove any moisture completely before dusting the squid with flour."
