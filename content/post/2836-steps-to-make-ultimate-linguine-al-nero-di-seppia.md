I did only once but instead of the classic linguine that goes with it, they mixed it with a kind of short pasta and they also give you a gigantic bib so that you don&#39;t dirty your shirt. It&#39;s really the dish that you should never eat with someone you are trying to. Cuocete le linguine in abbondante acqua salata e scolatele quando sono ancora al dente. Saltatele nella padella con le seppie per un paio di minuti.
