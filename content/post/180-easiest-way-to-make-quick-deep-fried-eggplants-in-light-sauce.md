- "Add the Step 3 eggplants into the Step 2 pot, and turn on the heat. Bring to a boil, and turn off the heat. Add the bonito flakes, and let the marinade cool down to make them absorb the flavour. Serve with grated daikon radish and ginger when you are ready to serve. Garnish with shiso leaves and green onions if you have them."
