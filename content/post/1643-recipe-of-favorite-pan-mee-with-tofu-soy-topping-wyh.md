recipeingredient:
- "300 gm INA Dried brown rice pan mee NOODLE"
- "1 Pot Seaweed anchovy soup SOUP"
- "200 gm Minced tofu in soy sauce with black fungus TOPPING 1"
- "40 gm Fried anchovies TOPPING 2"
- "20 gm MAEPRANOM Shrimp crushed chili TOPPING 3"
recipeinstructions:
- "Prepare SOUP first. Bring to pot, no frying required - 1L water, 1 tbsp soaked wakame seaweed, 1 anchovy stock cube, 80gm cubed turnip, 80gm cubed celery and salt white pepper to taste. Let simmer and set aside once nicely cooked. You can use any other vegetables you like (pan mee originally has no vege, but I like some)"
- "Prepare TOPPING 1. In a wok, heat 1 tsp sesame oil and fry sliced garlic (1 clove). When garlic is brown, add sliced tofu (I used 2pcs of square tofu), thinly sliced black fungus mushroom (3 pieces), chopped chili padi (just 1 - I like it spicy), 2 tbsp soy sauce and 1 tbsp oyster sauce. Stir fry in the wok at the same time squash the tofu with your spatula until it becomes minced - see pic. Set aside"
- "Prepare TOPPING 2. Wash thoroughly 40gm of anchovy &amp; drain. Heat oil in wok and fry anchovies til brown and crispy. Set aside"
- "Prepare NOODLES. Boil water in a medium sized pot with a little oil (to ensure noodles don&#39;t stick together). When it&#39;s boiling, put in noodles a few at a time, to ensure they have enough space to swim in. Boil for 8 minutes until soft with slight chewiness. Drain and move them to a bowl of cold water to stop the cooking."
- "Once everything is ready, place a generous amount of NOODLES for yourself into a deep bowl and add SOUP! We are ready to assemble!"
- "Top it off with TOPPING 1, then TOPPING 2 and lastly TOPPING 3. If you don&#39;t have flavored crush chili, normal chili flakes will do too - for me, as long as it&#39;s spicy!"
- "Done - WALA! #WhatYouHave"
