- "1 jar olives chopped into pieces without the pip"
- " Oil"
- "5/6 juniper berries"

recipeinstructions:
- "In a large pan bring water to boil with the juniper berries broke in half, the bay leaves, salt and a drop of white vinegar"
- "When it boils drop the octopus in the water by submerging it first 3/4 times as per video below. As you can see tentacles start to curl immediately with the hot water."
