- "Once you feel that the cheese has melted, it&#39;s done."
- "By the way, for the fillings in these I used yesterday&#39;s leftover sweet and salty beef with cheese."

- "Depending on how I&#39;m feeling or the fillings I&#39;m using, I sometimes cook them until they become crispy. Adjust the cooking time if you want them to be more chewy. Just cook them as you like."
