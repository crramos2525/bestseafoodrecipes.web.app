- "1 bowl Plain cooked rice"
- "5 tbsp Canned corn whole"
- "1 Soy sauce mentsuyu for roast corn"
- "1  Butter"
- "1  Aonori"
recipeinstructions:
- "Drain the canned corn well, and add the corn to a frying pan (don&#39;t need oil). Once the moisture has cooked off, add the soy sauce and test the flavor."
- "Add the rice, and top with aonori seaweed if you like. For seconds, mix in a bit of butter for a more western taste."
- "I worry that this might spoil in a summer bento box. Add an umeboshi when you cook it. The rice won&#39;t take on the flavor of the umeboshi, and the flavor of the umeboshi doesn&#39;t change either. It&#39;s mysterious."
- "For lunch on a hot and muggy day, I served lightly-warmed roast corn rice with salted konbu, wasabi, and cold tea. It was smooth and delicious."
- "Cook with minced ginger, sake, canned corn, the canned corn juices, soy sauce, and mentsuyu for a refreshing, delicious taste!"
- "Good for onigiri and bentos. My husband used his bento box from kindergarten 43 years ago and had this for lunch. Aluminum containers get really hot!"
