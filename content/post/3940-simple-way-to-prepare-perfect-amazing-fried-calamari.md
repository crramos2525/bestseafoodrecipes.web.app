Not only was the fried calamari excellent, but she also served it with a lemony aioli sauce and a side of fresh cut lemon that was divine. I&#39;ve always dipped in tartar sauce or marinara sauce, but this sauce was light and added to the experience. I managed to get the recipe from her for the sauce too.
