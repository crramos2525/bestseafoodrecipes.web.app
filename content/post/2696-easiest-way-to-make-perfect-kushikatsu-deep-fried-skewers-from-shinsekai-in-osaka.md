- "Cut each chikuwa into 5 pieces and stuff with cheese. Skewer 2 pieces at a time."

- "Fry them quickly in 170°C oil. The vegetable skewers take about a minute, and the meat skewers take about 2 minutes to cook."
- "When the skewers are golden brown and crispy, drain off the oil very well and put the skewers on a rack. When the oil has drained off completely transfer the skewers to a serving plate."
- "Scoop out any panko left in the oil after each batch is fried. The panko are very fine, so use a tea strainer to remove them until the oil is clean."
- "Dip the skewers completely in the special sauce. Dip the cut cabbage that&#39;s served with the skewers in the sauce too! Beer is the drink to serve with this!"
- "Today I fried quail eggs, cherry tomatoes, lotus root, shrimp, chikuwa stuffed with cheese, beef round, thinly sliced pork, okra, eggplant, chicken thigh meat, and asparagus."
- "These are authentic kushikatsu from a famous restaurant in Shinsekai. They were amazingly yummy!"
