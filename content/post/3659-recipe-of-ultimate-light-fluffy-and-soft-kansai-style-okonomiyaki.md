recipeingredient:
- "200 grams Plain flour"
- "250 grams Japanese dashi stock"
- "350 grams Nagaimo yam"
- "3 Eggs"
- "1/3 Cabbage"
- "1 Squid"
- "200 grams Thinly sliced pork belly"
- "1 Japanese leek"
- "50 grams Red pickled ginger optional"
- "1 Tempura crumbs"
recipeinstructions:
- "Make dashi stock (I used dried bonito, konbu and stock powder) and leave to cool. Chop the cabbage and pickled ginger. Slice the Japanese leek. After preparing the squid slice into thin batons (7 mm x 2-3 cm). Cut the tentacles into the similar sizes. Cut the pork into bite sizes or leave as they are."
- "Mix the flour with dashi stock and beaten eggs in a bowl. Peel and grate the nagaimo yam and add to the bowl. Mix in all the ingredients except the pork."
- "Heat vegetable oil in a non-stick pan and pour the batter. Fry over medium to high heat for about 3 minutes (don&#39;t cover or touch)."
- "Place the sliced pork on top. Shake the pan and remove the okonomiyaki bottom from the frying pan. Flip over when the edge of the batter starts to brown (the batter is quite runny, so it might be difficult.)"
- "After flipping over, cover with a lid and reduce heat to low. Fry for about 6 minutes and flip over when the bottom of the okonomiyaki is evenly browned. Cover with a lid and fry for another 3 minutes. Uncover and fry for another 3 minutes. Done!"
- "I noted the cooking time as 3 min → 6 min → 3 min → 3 min but my husband usually doesn&#39;t use a timer! When both sides are nicely browned like the top photo, it&#39;s ready. In the last 3 minutes, uncover and fry until crispy. This okonomiyaki has lots of nagaimo yam so the fluffy and soft texture remains even after cooking too long."
- "Serve with your favorite toppings."
- "My husband may change the ratio or ingredients in the future, so I will keep you posted."
