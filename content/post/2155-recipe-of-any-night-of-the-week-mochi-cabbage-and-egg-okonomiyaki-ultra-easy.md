- "1 Egg"
- "1 Japanese style Worcestershire sauce"
- "1 Mayonnaise"
- "1 tbsp Bonito flakes"
- "1 tbsp Water"
recipeinstructions:
- "Slice the mochi into 2-3mm. I got 15 slices out of 1 cake."
- "Scatter the mochi in a non-stick pan (18 cm diameter). Don&#39;t let the mochi slices overlap. No oil necessary."
- "Heat over medium heat. After 1 minute, the mochi will start to puff up a bit. The mochi pieces can get stuck together or stay apart with gaps in between at this point."

- "Turn off the heat, and drizzle on the mayonnaise and sauce while it&#39;s still in the pan. They&#39;ll sizzle up a bit and add more flavor."
- "Top with bonito flakes and it&#39;s done! It tastes like a proper okonomiyaki."
