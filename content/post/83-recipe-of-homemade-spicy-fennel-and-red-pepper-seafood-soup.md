- "When potatoes have softened, blend the soup until it’s smooth. Return to stove, bring to simmer, and let it reduce down. It should be fairly thick. Add your actual cream until desired richness and consistency. Salt to taste."
- "Prep your seafood into bite size chunks. Poach in the soup for 5-10 minutes or until cooked. Garnish with fennel leaves."
