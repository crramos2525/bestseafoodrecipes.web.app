This amazing pizza is topped with sweet and juicy pineapples, spruced up with a sprinkling of peppy herbs and spice powders. A tongue-tickling mix of cubed tofu and soy sauce boosts the taste of the pizza and also adds another interesting texture to it. Laced with Oriental sauces like hoisin sauce and. Fresh tuna loin is grilled to perfection and sliced to be combined in tortilla wraps with pineapple, chili and cilantro flavored rice.
