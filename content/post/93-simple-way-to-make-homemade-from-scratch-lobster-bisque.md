recipeingredient:
- "2 large lobsters 2 pounders or more"
- "10 cup water"
- "3 tbsp olive oil"
- "2 stick butter"
- "1 large onion minced"
- "3 large carrots minced"
- "2 large celery stalks minced"
- "3 tbsp salt"
- "1 tbsp garlic granulated"
- "1 tbsp bay leaf powder"
- "1 tsp cayenne pepper"
- "1 tbsp ground black pepper"
- "1/2 cup dry white wine"
- "18 oz tomato paste"
- "2 pints heavy cream"
- "3 tbsp cornstarch"
recipeinstructions:
- "Boil the lobsters in an 8 quart stock pot until they are red and pretty well cooked, between 10 and 15 minutes or so."
- "Reserve 10 cups of the boiling water, as this will be the base of the bisque."
- "Break down the lobster into meat and shells/carcasses, placing the shells back into the reserved water and setting aside the meat."
- "Boil the shells/carcasses about ten minutes, and then discard the shells/carcasses while saving the water."
- "Set the water aside, place the oil, butter, onion, carrot, celery, salt, bay, garlic, and cayenne into a large frying pan, and sweat it all out a bit.  Yes, it is a lot of butter, but bisque is buttery."

- "Add the veggie sludge to the lobster water, mix well, and simmer on medium low."
- "Add the tomato paste, and mix really well to get the blobs out."
- "Add the heavy cream.  Yes, it is a lot of cream, but bisque is creamy.  Mix."
- "Take a cup of the broth, let it cool a few minutes, and mix the cornstarch into it."
- "Add the cornstarch mixture back to the broth, mix it in, and then simmer and stir to thicken, for about 20 minutes or so."
- "Mince the lobster meat, and then add it to the broth.  Don&#39;t add it sooner, else you may create rubbery meat bits."
- "Serve immediately, though it might still be a bit thin.  It will thicken by the next day, though.  If I had you add more cornstarch, it would be all congealed by the next day."
