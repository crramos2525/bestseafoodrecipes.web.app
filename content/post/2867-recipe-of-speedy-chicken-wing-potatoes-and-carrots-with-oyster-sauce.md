What I ended up with was overcooked chicken and undercooked carrots (and I do love. Chicken wings and potatoes are pan-fried, before being simmered to perfection. In a large shallow dish, mix together the oyster sauce, black soy sauce, sugar cornflour, oil and water to make the marinade. Thoroughly combine the Shaoxing wine, soy sauce, and oyster sauce in a bowl, and pour it over the chicken and the scallions. I grew up on chicken wings and oyster sauce with fermented black beans (my dad was a Chinese cook) and so I did have to change the recipe up a little.
