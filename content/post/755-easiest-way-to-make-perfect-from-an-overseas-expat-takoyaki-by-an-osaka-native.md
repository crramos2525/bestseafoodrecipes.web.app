recipeinstructions:

- "Cover the bowl of batter with plastic wrap, and let it rest in the refrigerator. In the meantime, get the fillings ready."

- "When the takoyaki maker has heated properly, oil it generously. Use plenty of oil to make the outsides crispy!!"
- "Pour in batter to fill about 80 to 90% full. Put a piece of octopus (or other filling) into each hole. The flour tends to sink to the bottom of the batter, so give it a little stir each time you pour it in."

- "It looks like this when you flip the balls. It looks like a mess, but don&#39;t worry."
- "Flip the balls repeatedly while tucking the raggedy pieces under them. The balls will become rounder and rounder. Add some oil if needed."
- "When the balls are done, pour on the toppings of your choice and enjoy!"
- "Since I live overseas, it&#39;s difficult for me to get a hold of octopus. So I substitute it with squid or shrimp. I make my own tenkasu, and blend my own sauce."
