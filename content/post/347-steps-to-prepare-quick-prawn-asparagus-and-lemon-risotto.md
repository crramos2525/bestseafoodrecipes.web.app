We love seafood and this Prawn and Asparagus Risotto is really versatile as you can add lots of other shellfish or even some squid. This is a lemon and prawns risotto recipe, to which I&#39;ve added just a bit of lemon and lemon zest, which brightens up the dish. It is absolutely perfect for all year around. I&#39;ve used chicken stock, but you can easily make this a vegetarian risotto changing the stock and the prawns for asparagus.
