recipeinstructions:
- "Wash the sushi rice under running water. Add the rice to the pan and bring the water to the boil. Reduce heat, cover with a lid and simmer for 35 minutes. Turn off the heat and allow to steam for a further 10 minutes. If you feel that the water has absorbed, turn off the heat a little earlier rather than burn it to the bottom.

- "Place a tablespoon of rice in wet hands, add a square of avocado in the middle and roll into a ball. You can use kitchen wrap if you prefer. Roll the ball in your choice of seaweeds or seeds. Allow to cool and chill for at least an hour if you are transporting them(this will stop them breaking. Enjoy :)"
