One of the main things in Italian cooking is the use of fresh ingredients, and that is the same thing you can expect from Calabrian food. A perfect example of this is Insalata di Polpo, otherwise known as Octopus Salad. Octopus (polipo or polpo in Italian) is delightful when it is cooked properly—tender and buttery soft—and it is wonderful in summer seafood salads such as octopus and potato salad (insalata di polpo e patate) or simply grilled with lemon. But it can be devilish to cook, going from tender to rubbery and back as it sits in the pot. Boiled potatoes is, perhaps, the most popular complement to the octopus, in which case you can call your salad an insalata di polpo e patate.
