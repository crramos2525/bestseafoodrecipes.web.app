- "If the shrimp have their tails on, rub the pointed part of each tail with the side of your knife as if you were sharpening it to squeeze out the water. If you don&#39;t do this the shrimp will spit oil in the heated pan, so be careful!"

- "I tried pan frying the shrimp too. It was a success - there wasn&#39;t much difference in frying the coating, compared to deep frying. Be careful not to let the batter fall off when you turn the shrimp over."
- "Make the sauce. Mix all the sauce ingredients together, microwave for about 20 seconds, then mix again."
- "Coat the shrimp with the mayonnaise sauce and it&#39;s done! I deep fried asparagus with it. You could also add octopus or potatoes."
- "The shrimp are also great with pea shoots that have been blanched for about 20 seconds! I recommend it."
