Carpaccio is a dish of meat or fish (such as beef, veal, venison, salmon or tuna), thinly sliced or pounded thin, and served raw, typically as an appetizer. Octopus cooked sous-vide is very flavorful and tender, and sliced thinly as carpaccio is a great way of serving it. Last year I prepared octopus carpaccio, but the slices fell apart. Cut the tentacles from the octopuses&#39; bodies (reserve the bodies for adding to the salad recipe below). The color of the octopus and the gelatin around the parts suggest the octopus was boiled and chilled.
