Today I&#39;m partnering with Swanson to share this incredible butternut squash pot pie recipe with my favorite broth - Swanson Vegetable Broth! It uses butternut squash instead of pumpkin, which are equally available, and easier to cook. Out of butter, I used vegetable oil instead. Also, I rotated it a few times. So easy, and not as likely to give me heartburn the way pumpkin pie often has.
