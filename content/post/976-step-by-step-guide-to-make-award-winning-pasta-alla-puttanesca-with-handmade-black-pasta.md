recipeingredient:
- " or use storebought pasta instead The pasta ingredients"
- "100 grams or so Durum semolina"
- "1 Egg"
- "1 dash of a good quality oil Olive oil"
- "1 pinch Natural Salt"
- "1 tsp Squid ink"
- " For the sauce"
- "1 Olive oil"
- "1 Red chili pepper"
- "1 clove Garlic"
- "1 bit less than 12 teaspoon Anchovy paste"
- "1 small can Canned tuna"
- "1 the same amount as the tuna Tomato sauce or puree"
- "1 tbsp Capers"
- "1 tbsp Black olives"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put the durum semolina in a large bowl, and form a well in the middle. Put the other pasta ingredients in the well."
- "Mix up the ingredients in the well with a fork. Gradually crumble the semolina &#39;wall&#39; around it to mix in."
- "When it&#39;s more or less mixed together, start kneading."
- "Knead the dough well and form a ball. Leave the dough to rest for a while (If the dough is stiff, add a little water to adjust.)"
- "Roll the rested dough about 3 to 5 mm thick (no. 3 on the thickness dial on a pasta machine)."
- "Fold the dough into thirds."
- "Roll the folded dough again to 3-5 mm thickness."
- "Fold the dough again, tucking in the ragged edges."
- "Roll the dough out to your desired thickness. The dough in the photo is rolled out with no. 5 on the thickness dial of the pasta machine."
- "Dust both sides of the rolled out dough with flour."
- "Cut the dough. If you don&#39;t have a pasta machine, flour the dough well and slice with a knife."
- "Dry the pasta out for 10 minutes to an hour after cutting it so that the strands don&#39;t stick together. The pasta is done. You can dry it on a rack as shown in step 13."
- "You can dry the pasta completely on a rack at this stage, but it becomes brittle so handle it carefully. By drying the pasta out, it becomes elastic."
- "Make the sauce while the pasta dries. Put the sliced red chili pepper, garlic, olive oil and anchovy paste in a small pan, and stir fry until fragrant. Adjust the saltiness by adding more or less anchovy!"
- "Add the rest of the sauce ingredients and simmer."
- "Boil the pasta for 1 to 3 minutes in plenty of boiling water. Add a little olive oil to the cooking water to prevent the pasta from sticking. Since puttanesca sauce is salty because of the anchovies, you don&#39;t need to salt the cooking water unlike with other pasta dishes."
- "Serve the sauce on the pasta."
- "If you want to fully enjoy the flavor of the black squid ink pasta on its own: Boil in salted water. Omit step 15 of the sauce making process. Sauté the pasta in the spicy garlic oil from step 14 with a little bit of the cooking water, and make a simple aglio, olio e peperoncino."
