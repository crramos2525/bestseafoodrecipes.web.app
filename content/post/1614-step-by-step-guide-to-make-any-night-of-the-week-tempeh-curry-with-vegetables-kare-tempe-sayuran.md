Soy products do not make up a significant part of my diet; I have concerns about how highly processed some soy products are. But I&#39;ll occasionally enjoy some minimally processed, whole food soy, namely tofu or tempeh. Then mix in the mould and proceed as for the rest of the recipe. Chickpeas along with lentils and other legumes make great soy-free options for tempeh.

Tempeh coated and seared with with blackening spice makes a tasty addition to salads and vegetable bowls. Use a prepared Cajun-style seasoning or make your own with equal parts paprika, cayenne, black pepper, garlic Add crumbled, grated, or cubed tempeh to spaghetti sauce, stew, chili, or curry.
