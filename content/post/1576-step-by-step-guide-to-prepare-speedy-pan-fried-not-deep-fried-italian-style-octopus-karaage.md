- "1 to 2 tablespoons Grated cheese"
- "1 tsp Grated garlic"

- "Add oil, butter and garlic in a pan over medium heat, and add the octopus. Try not to touch the octopus as it fries, or the coating will come off."

- "Note 1: The boiled octopus and the grated cheese are salty, so I don&#39;t add salt. Taste, and adjust with more cheese or a little salt."
- "Note 2: Both octopus and squid spit when heated! It&#39;s not fun at all to burn yourself. Just cover with a lid if this becomes a problem."
