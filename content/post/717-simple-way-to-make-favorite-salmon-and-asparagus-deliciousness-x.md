The salmon, asparagus and garlic get caramelized in the flavorful browned butter then the lemon takes this dish to the next level. I cooked the salmon and asparagus in one pan because they cook at the same rate and I wanted all the flavors of the garlic-lemon and butter to mix throughout the entire.
