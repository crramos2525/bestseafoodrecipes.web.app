- " Chicken tenders"
- " Umeboshi paste"
- " Shiso leaves"
- " sheets Toasted nori seaweed"
- " Vegetable oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Remove the skin and sinews from the chicken tenders, open them up, and lightly stroke with the back of a knife to stretch it out and even out the thickness."
- "Spread out kneaded pickled plum onto step 1, place the shiso leaves on top, and roll up from the side. The shiso leaves were small, so I used two for the one shown in the photo."
- "This is what they should look like. Don&#39;t worry about the meat ripping in step 1 since they&#39;ll get wrapped up in nori seaweed. Just roll them up."
- "Cut the nori seaweed to the size of the chicken tenders, and roll up step 3. I rolled these up in a cut  half sheet of nori seaweed."
- "Place the overlap facing downwards, and let sit for a while so that the nori seaweed closes up. The nori seaweed will shrink when toasted, so there is no need to wrap them tightly."
- "Heat up oil in a frying pan, line up the rolls with the overlaps facing downwards, cover with a lid, and fry. Cook all the way through."
- "Cut into bite-sized pieces and serve into plates. This is rather tasty with just the flavor of the kneaded pickled plum, but it is also tasty with grated ponzu sauce as well."
