Brush the top of the salmon with the olive oil; sprinkle with the salt and pepper. This elegant dish features the classic pairing of dill sauce and salmon and is remarkably easy to make. Lemon juice gives the dish a bit of acidic tartness, and it can be made with either plain or Greek-style yogurt for a more richly textured sauce, which works equally well on high-end Pacific king salmon as. Add the prawns, half the dill, lemon zest, half the lemon juice and a good grind of black pepper.
