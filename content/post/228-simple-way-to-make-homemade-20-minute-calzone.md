- "300 grams Bread strong flour or cake flour"
- "1 tsp Dry yeast or baking powder"
- "1 tbsp Sugar"
- "1 tbsp Olive oil"

- " Cheese for pizza mozzarella etc"

- " Ham onions green peppers bacon sausages eggplants boiled eggs canned tuna etc and leftover curry ratatouille meat sauce potato salad etc"
recipeinstructions:
- "Mix the bread flour and salt, add the sugar and dry yeast in the center, and knead by adding the olive oil and hot water a little at a time until the dough no longer sticks to your hands."
- "Divide the dough from Step 1 into four portions, and make them into balls. Leave them for about 5 minutes if you have time. During this time, prepare the ingredients for the filling. It is easy and quick if you mix all the filling ingredients before the next step."
- "Dust the board with flour (not included in the ingredients list), and roll the dough out into a circle shape with a rolling pin. Spread the tomato sauce on the dough, place the filling in, and fold in half. It is easy to fold if you place the filling one just one half of the dough."
- "Seal the seams by pressing edges with a fork, etc. You can also seal the seams by rolling up the edges and tucking the rolled end! Any way is okay if it keeps the filling inside."
- "Place the dough from Step 4 in the preheated frying pan over low heat, and bake for about 5 minutes on each side with a lid on until browned. It&#39;s done."
- "Example filling combinations are 1) ham and cheese, 2) canned tuna and boiled eggs, 3) microwaved eggplants and sausages, 4) sautéed spinach and egg, 5) bacon and onions... etc."
- "Try any filling combinations you think will be good with cheese, like with pizza Leftover curry and ratatouille are also good If you use any ingredients that are hard to cook through, parboil or heat beforehand."
- "It is recommended to use 5 g of baking powder instead of dry yeast if using cake flour. Bread flour with baking powder is also okay. Work with what you have at home!"
- "I make different sizes of calzone for my family to adjust the amount each of us can eat."
