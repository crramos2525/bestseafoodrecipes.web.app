I like to serve it on a bed of rice with stir fried vegetables, or even sliced in sandwiches. Tapioca pearls, also called tapioca balls or boba, are small translucent spheres. Their cooked size is usually somewhere between a pea and a marble, and they&#39;re made with tapioca starch, which comes from the cassava root. Silken tofu can be used for more than eating as taho.
