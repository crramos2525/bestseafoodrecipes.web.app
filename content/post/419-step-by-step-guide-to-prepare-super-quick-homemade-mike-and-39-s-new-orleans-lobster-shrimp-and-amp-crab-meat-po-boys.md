It has an intense, complicated flavor that comes from making a patiently toasted roux, cajun spices, shrimp stock and finally okra which makes this thick, rich stew But but but don&#39;t close the window yet because trust me when I say - you WILL want to try this New Orleans sausage shrimp gumbo! We started by determining the best cooking method for our version of New Orleans Barbecue Shrimp; in this case, searing the shrimp first, then sautéing the aromatics before returning the shrimp to the skillet to. You&#39;re watching: New Orleans-Style Barbequed Shrimp. This video shows you how to make flavorful New Orleans-style, grill-free barbequed shrimp. We&#39;re talking big, big flavors all around here, in the shrimp marinade, the shrimp stock (which you&#39;ll see how to prepare using the shrimp shells). flickr/Michael Daddino.
