recipeinstructions:
- "Make Clear Soup. Heat Dashi Stock and season with Mirin, Salt and Soy Sauce in a saucepan, and let it cool down so that it can be mixed with Eggs."
- "Whisk Eggs in a mixing bowl and add warm Soup gradually and mix well. We are often taught to pour the egg mixture through a fine strainer to make it smooth, but I don’t do that. Just remove bubbles from the mixture."
- "Prepare other ingredients. My method doesn’t pre-cook Chicken or Seafood, so you should use small ones or cut them into small pieces."

- "Place the ingredients in small bowls, cups, ramekins or whatever you use."
- "Pour the egg mixture over the ingredients carefully. Place a young Italian parsley leaf or &#39;Shungiku&#39; on top. In Japan, most commonly &#39;Mitsuba&#39; leaf is placed on top, but Italian parsley tastes very similar. And it is optional."
- "Cook them in hot steamer or microwave oven. OR you may prefer cooking them in the oven in the same way to cook Creme Brûlée."
- "Serve &#39;Chawanmushi&#39; with small spoons."
