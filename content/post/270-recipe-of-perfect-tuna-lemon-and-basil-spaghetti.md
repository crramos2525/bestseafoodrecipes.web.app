Sprinkle the basil over, season with salt and freshly ground pepper and serve immediately. I cooked up some simple spaghetti and drizzled it with fresh lemon juice and olive oil and tossed in some fresh basil then seasoned it with sea salt and freshly cracked pepper. The sharpness of lemon, the heat of chilli, the sprightliness of spring onions and the tender pepperiness of rocket, combine beautifully with the oily tuna. Put a big pan of water on to boil for the pasta and, once boiling, salt the water and add the spaghetti, cooking according to packet instructions, though.
