- "50 grams Capellini"

- "1 small Green chilli peppers"
- "2 stems Coriander"
- "2 tbsp Fish sauce"
- "1 tbsp Kabosu citrus or lemon juice"

- "3 tbsp Tomato"
- "1/4 small Onion"
- "1 tbsp Vegetable oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Sprinkle some salt and pepper over the beef. Stir-fry the beef in a hot frying pan greased with vegetable oil until both sides are brown. The beef will taste better if it is still a little pink in the middle so it&#39;s best not to overcook it. Once cooked, cut the meat into thin slices."
- "Finely chop the tomato and thinly slice the onion. If the taste of the onion is a bit harsh then try soaking it in some water."
- "Add 1 tablespoon of oil to a hot saucepan. Then add the chopped garlic, green chilli pepper, coriander, sugar, water, oyster sauce, fish sauce and lemon juice and mix everything together. The sauce will be ready after 2-3 minutes. If the flavour is too strong for you then feel free to adjust the concentration with some water."
- "Boil the capellini for 1 minute longer than instructed to on the packet then rinse in cold water. Thoroughly pat the pasta dry with kitchen paper."
- "Mix together the pasta and the sauce, then mix in the chopped tomatoes and sliced onion. Serve the sliced beef on top and it&#39;s ready."
