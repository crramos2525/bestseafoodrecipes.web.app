Add garlic, oregano, and red pepper flakes and season with salt and pepper. I have been making this for so long, can&#39;t recall where it came from. Giada De Laurentiis&#39; Cioppino, an Italian-American fisherman&#39;s stew, is a lighter alternative to heavy holiday meals, from Everyday Italian on Food Network. After doing a little research and finding recipes for cioppino seafood stew that used either chicken broth or clam juice, I decided to do a mix of the two. Even with the simplifying of a more traditional cioppino Italian seafood stew recipe, my Easy Cioppino Seafood Stew was very tasty.
