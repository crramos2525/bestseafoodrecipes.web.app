What gives the spicy tuna roll its kick is the spicy mayo sauce. You wouldn&#39;t believe how easy that is to make! My recommendation is to prepare double that amount and serving the remainder as dipping sauce. The spicy California roll gets the addition of a creamy, fiery sriracha mayo. You can either incorporate it with the other ingredients inside your California roll - or you can drizzle it on top after cutting.
