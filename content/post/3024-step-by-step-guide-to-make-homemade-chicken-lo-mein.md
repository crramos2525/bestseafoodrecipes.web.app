- " soy sauce"
- " Oyster sauce"
- " Olive oil"
- " Teriyaki sauce or Asian sauce optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "Heat up pan with a splash of olive oil? When oil is hot cook the meat, and some soy sauce And chicken stock.when meat is done remove from pan, and leave the juices from the meat in the pan... when cooking the meat also start the spaghetti noodles in a different pot."
- "Set meat aside let rest.add all frozen veggies, some more soy sauce, cook veggies till done, mix Occasionally,"
- "When noodles are done, remove from heat, and let sit in the pot of water till veggies are done. They should get done about the same time."
- "Drain water from the noodles and add to veggies, and a splash of Olive oil and Oyster sauce and more soy sauce if you like, can add any Asia sauce or teriyaki sauce at this time. Mix well then add the meat, mix well again. Remove from heat and it’s done."
- "Notes-Cook everything on high heat in frying pan or wok. I didn’t give measurements cook to taste. The oysters sauce is what gives the noodles that brown look so don’t be scared to use a lot of it. I use spaghetti noodles because it’s cheaper than the lo mein and I can never find them kind of noodles in the first place, plus I make a lot, sometimes I will use two bags of stir fry veggies, just depends on how much I want to make and how hungry everyone is."
