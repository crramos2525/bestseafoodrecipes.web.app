recipeinstructions:
- "Cut the stem ends off. They look better if you leave the calyxes on, but I take &#39;em off! The prickly parts can hurt you, and it&#39;s easier to eat the eggplants with the tops off."
- "Score the surface of the eggplants lengthwise 4 to 5 times."
- "Grill the eggplants until they are charred and pitch black on the surface. (This is important!) They are done if they are completely limp when you press on them with chopsticks!"
- "I grilled them in our toaster oven on medium heat for 22 minutes. If your grill only cooked one side at a time, turn the eggplants over halfway through."

- "Even if the skin breaks as you peel it because you&#39;re peeling it so thinly, be sure to only pinch up the skin, not the eggplant flesh! Here&#39;s a photo of 3 completely peeled eggplants."
