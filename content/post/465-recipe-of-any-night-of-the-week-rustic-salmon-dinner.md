- "When the vegetables in the oven are done, transfer all vegetables to the quinoa and mix. Set aside to cool."

Also with another oven tray (preferably the tray with grill tray) place the pepper on top. Place the tray with the pepper to the highest rack and the salmon on to the middle rack. Cook for 12-15 at 210 degrees Celsius."
