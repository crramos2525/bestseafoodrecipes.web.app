Hello everybody, it's Brad, welcome to my recipe site. Today, I will show you a way to prepare a distinctive dish, taquitos. One of my favorites. This time, I am going to make it a bit unique. This will be really delicious.

Taquitos is one of the most popular of current trending foods on earth. It's appreciated by millions daily. It is easy, it's fast, it tastes yummy. They're fine and they look wonderful. Taquitos is something that I have loved my whole life.

In a large bowl, combine chicken, cream cheese, chipotle and sauce, cumin, and chili powder. Corn tortillas are tightly rolled around a cheesy chicken mixture and baked until crisp. Serve these baked taquitos as an appetizer with salsa or top with lettuce, tomato, and sour cream for a main course.


To begin with this recipe, we must prepare a few ingredients. You can cook taquitos using 10 ingredients and 6 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.

##### The ingredients needed to make Taquitos:

Add chili powder, garlic, cumin, minced onion, beef broth and salsa. The great thing is this taquito recipe is versatile so you can use any type of meat - beef taquitos, chicken taquitos or pork - as long as it shreds easily. The taquitos I&#39;ve always seen are only as big around as your finger. So use a teeny bit of filling and wrap the warmed tortilla tightly before securing with toothpicks.
