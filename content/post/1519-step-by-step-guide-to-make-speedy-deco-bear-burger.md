- "While the burgers are cooking, prepare the bear&#39;s face! Cut the sliced cheese into a circle for face, and smaller semi-circles for ears. Cut seaweed for eyes and mouth, using a &#34;deco cutter.&#34; Finally, add ketchup for lovely rosy cheeks."
- "You can find a deco cutter in stationary stores in Japan. The lid of a plastic bottle is helpful for cutting cheese in perfect circles."
