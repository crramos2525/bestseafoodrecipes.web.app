recipeingredient:
- "400 ml fruit juice"
- "50 ml water if using agaragar and reduce the fruit juice by 50ml"
- "100 grams fruit of choice optional"
- " agaragar powder or flakes as required by pack instruction"
- " or use 4 sheets Dr Oetkers leaf gelatine"
recipeinstructions:
- "Boil the water and add the agar stirring until dissolved. Different brands have different diluting instructions but the basic rule is 1tsp powder/ 1 tbsp flakes to 8 fl oz / 240 mls liquid. If using leaf gelatine, soak the sheets in cold water and then discard the water, adding straight to the boiling juice"
- "Pour the agar mix into the fruit juice and stir well until thickening"
- "Layer the fruit in the botton of your mould or moulds, I prefer to use individual ones for the children, then pour the liquid on top"
- "Let cool, then refrigerate to set. Citrus fruits will take longer to set so I add an extra quarter teaspoon of powder if I&#39;m using say, orange"
- "To free from the mould set it in hot water for a few seconds."
- "The texture using agar-agar is not exactly the same as regular gelatine jelly but still highly enjoyable"
