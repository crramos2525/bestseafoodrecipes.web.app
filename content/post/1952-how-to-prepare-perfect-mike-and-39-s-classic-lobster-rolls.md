recipeinstructions:
- "Add everything in the, &#34;Lobster Meat Mixture,&#34; category except for the lobster in a large bowl and mix well. You will need more mayo than is called for. Tablespoon by tablespoon add more mayonnaise until it reaches the creamy consistency you desire. I usually add 3 additional tablespoons."
- "De-thaw your lobster tails in water if frozen. Do not steam/boil/cook frozen."
- "Once thawed, cut the underside of your lobster tails lengthwise and remove meat. Rinse lobster meat and discard anything you deem undesirable."
- "Fill 1-1/2&#34; of water and 2 tablespoons butter in a pot with a tight fitting lid. Bring to a boil and add lobster meat. Reduce heat to low and simmer/steam lobster meat for 5 to 6 minutes."
- "Once cooked, place on plate to cool. Chop lobster meat and add to lobster meat mixture and mix. Place in fridge until fully chilled."
- "Carefully tear 4 lengthwise rolls from the other 8. Then another 4 lengthwise rolls from the 8. This will leave you with 3 long sweet sub rolls each consisting of 4 mini rolls. Note: There are also King&#39;s Hawaiian Mini Sub Rolls available now that come in packs of 6 and are pre-split. I&#39;ve used those in the photo below. You can find these rolls in the deli section of your local supermarket."
- "Carefully slice lengthwise down the side of your roll [if using the 12 pack] to create an opening for your lobster meat without cutting it completely in half."
- "You can use these rolls as they are or butter and sear them in a hot pan. If I sear them, I lightly butter the rolls and lightly sprinkle with garlic powder."
- "Smear a layer of guacamole on one side of your roll. Add shredded lettuce and pile on your lobster meat mixture. Sprinkle liberally with Old Bay Seasoning and a pinch of Celery Salt. Also, add a long, thin dill pickle spear at the top of sandwich and serve with Salt &amp; Vinegar Chips to cut some of the richness."
- "To reduce the overall carbs, you can use low carb bread and omit the guacamole."
- "Enjoy!"
