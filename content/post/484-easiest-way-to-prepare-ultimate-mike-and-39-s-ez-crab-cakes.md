It&#39;s not recommended that crab cakes be stored in the refrigerator for. Crab cakes should be all about the crab â€” no questions asked. They should be crispy on the outside, moist and flaky on the inside, and taste exclusively of fresh, delicious crab: no fillers or excess spices getting in the way. If you agree, you&#39;ve come to the right place.
