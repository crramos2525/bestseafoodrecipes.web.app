recipeinstructions:
- "Prepare the vegan dashi stock in advance. You will need to lightly simmer 1 shiitake and 1 inch piece of kombu per cup of water. A long and gentle simmer is best but if you are short of time you can make in half an hour. Cool until ready to use. Vegan dashi can be used in lots of recipes and adds umami 😋"

- "Dip each side of the tofu square into the potato flour. Heat a little oil and gently fry on each side. It should colour but not brown."
