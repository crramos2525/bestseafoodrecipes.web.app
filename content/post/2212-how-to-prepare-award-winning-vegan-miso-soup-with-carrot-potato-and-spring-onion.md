You&#39;re just going to fry up some onion and garlic in a little coconut oil and some dried herbs, then add some chopped carrots and peeled and chopped potatoes and sauté them a little to spread the flavors. I may have overdone it with the miso a bit. This Vegan Potato Soup is perfectly smooth, rich and creamy without any cream, and it&#39;s chunky and super-filling. You won&#39;t be hungry an hour after eating it like with a lot of soups. To a large saucepan, add the vegan butter/oil and warm over a medium heat before adding the onions, celery and carrots.
