- "1 Scallop"
- "1 Coarse salt"
- "5 grams Butter"
- "1 tsp Soy sauce"
recipeinstructions:
- "Use a dinner knife or a metal spatula to open the scallop shell. Pry it apart slowly, starting from the flat part of the shell. There&#39;s a small gap near the hinged part, so open it from there."
- "This is how it looks with one half of the shell taken off. Scrape off the contents, leaving nothing behind."
- "Scrap the scallop contents off the other half cleanly too. Work carefully and slowly. If you rush it you&#39;ll leave bits behind."
- "This is how it looks with the contents removed."
- "The black part is the stomach and can have accumulated poisons. It&#39;s not eaten so remove it."
- "This is the egg or sperm sac and is delicious. If it&#39;s whitish it&#39;s a male, and if it&#39;s reddish it&#39;s a female. This one is a male."
- "Take the tough connective tissue off with your hands, and take the gills and any slime off with the back of the knife. If you are going to cook the scallop thoroughly you can eat the gills too!"
- "Massage the connective tissue part with salt to remove any sliminess. Cut into easy to eat pieces."
- "Put the scallops, egg or sperm sac and frilly edges back into the rounded half of the shell. Add 5 g per shell."
- "Preheat the oven to 250°C. Bake the scallop shells for 2 minutes. If you&#39;re using a toaster oven, bake for 3 minutes."
- "After 2 minutes, drizzle in 1 teaspoon of soy sauce into each shell, and bake for a further 3 minutes (5 minutes if using a toaster oven)."
- "Sprinkle a little coarse salt onto the serving plates so that the shells will be stable on them."
- "When the shells are baked, put them on the plates and press down lightly to stabilize them."
