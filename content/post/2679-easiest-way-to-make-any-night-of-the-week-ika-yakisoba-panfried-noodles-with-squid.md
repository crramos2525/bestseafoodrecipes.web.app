recipeinstructions:
- "Separate the noodles, put them in a heated non-stick frying pan, and pan fry them over high-medium heat to brown them. When they start to make a crackling sound, turn them over."
- "When some of the noodles are very lightly browned, transfer the noodles to a plate."
- "Julienne the cabbage thinly Soak in a bowl of water for a while, and drain."
- "Open up the squid. We&#39;ll use the head part and the legs for this recipe. You can use the good body part too, but I use that for other recipes."
- "Cut the legs apart into pairs, then cut each leg into thirds. Cut the head part in half lengthwise and then slice thinly."
- "Put the ground pork in the frying pan you used to cook the noodles and stir fry. When it&#39;s more or less cooked, add the squid and stir fry again. (Medium heat.)"

- "When everything is well mixed it&#39;s done! Optionally serve topped with aonori or a fried egg and so on."
- "The flavor of Worcestershire-style sauce differs by the brand, so adjust to taste."
- "Basically, it&#39;s OK to cook this without adding any oil, but if you&#39;re worried that it will stick, you can add some when you pan fry the noodles."
