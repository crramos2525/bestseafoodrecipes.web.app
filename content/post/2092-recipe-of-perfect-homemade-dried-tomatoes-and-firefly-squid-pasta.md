- "To prepare the pasta, add a little less than 1 tablespoon of salt to 1L of boiling water (just enough to give the water a salty flavor)."
- "While the pasta is boiling, shred the red peppers with the seeds removed, mince the garlic, and sauté in a pan with 2 tablespoons of olive oil."
- "Once the garlic changes color, drop in the firefly squid and fry. Add the dried tomato and about 1 ladle of the pasta water."
- "About 2 minutes before the pasta boils, remove and add to Step 6. Mix everything well and after the pasta stock has been absorbed, mix in the celery leaves and it&#39;s finished!"
- "The salt from the pasta water and the squid should provide enough flavoring. Season with salt to taste."
- "Addendum: If you leave the tomatoes out in the sun for half a day, you&#39;ll have solar-powered sweetness! This also shortens the baking time!"
