- "Once done, let the jelly cool down then put the molds into the fridge at least 1h until the jelly is firm completely. (2h-3h) Easier with silicone mold."
- "Once the jelly sets completely, take it out. Cut into small pieces."
- "Keep the jelly in the fridge. Use within 1 -2 days."
- "Best served wih iced milk coffee."
