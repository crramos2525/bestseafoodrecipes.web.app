recipeinstructions:
- "Before, this recipe called for a frying pan and a pot, but I&#39;ve improved it so that you can make it in just one pot!"
- "Cut the potatoes and carrots into large pieces. Cut the chicken into pieces of even thickness. If using boned meat, insert the knife between the meat and the bone."
- "To help reduce the cooking time, place Step 2 into a heat-resistant container, add vinegar, cover with plastic wrap, and microwave at 600W for 6-8 minutes. You don&#39;t have to cook everything through."
- "Make the roux. Add the ● ingredients to the pot and cook on low-medium heat until the roux dissolves."
- "Once dissolved add the ◇ water a little at a time to soften the roux. Once it&#39;s softened add the remaining water and the other ◇ ingredients."
- "Add your microwaved vegetables from Step 3, together with the juice, to the pot from Step 5. Add the ☆ ingredients and simmer until the potatoes soften (about 5 minutes)."
- "Use salt and soy sauce to adjust the flavor, and garam masala to adjust the spiciness. You can substitute ichimi pepper or red pepper. Use chutney (left in the picture) to add sweetness, or substitute honey."
- "You can find chutney in the curry corner of your supermarket for about 100 yen. Frozen is also okay. It definitely makes for a better flavor than honey!!"
- "Transfer the finished soup, potatoes, carrots, and chicken to a dish. Top with deep-fried vegetables or whatever fillings you like and it&#39;s complete."
- "Let it sit for a half day to a full day and it&#39;ll become even more delicious. Make the soup in the morning, then all you have to do is fry the vegetables at night."
- "Try adding a small amount of oyster sauce or fish sauce as a delicious hidden ingredient."
- "I made naan bread in a toaster. I recommend adding melting cheese to the center before stretching out the bread, for cheese naan."
- "Add rice, saffron, salt (a small amount of each) to your rice cooker to make saffron rice."
- "Recommended fillings 1: Potatoes, carrots, weiners, shimeji mushrooms, chicken wings. Boil everything together. Pictured is a chunk of pork belly."
- "Recommended fillings 2: Eggplant, lotus root (add after washing to remove scum), pumpkin, green pepper."
- "Add the chicken wings, potatoes, and shimeji mushrooms to the bottom in a pyramid shape, and then pour the soup in."
- "Then place the carrots, green peppers, eggplant, etc on top. Cut the egg vertically. Then add your pepper last for a restaurant-like feel."
- "To eat, you can add the soup to rice. Or add rice to the soup. Or mix the filling in with the rice. There&#39;s lots of different ways to eat it, and all of them are good."
- "If you have any soup left over you can use it the following day in a risotto, or with noodles. Enjoy this down to the last drop!"
