recipeingredient:
- "20 phyllo small  pastry shells  already prepared to be filled"
- " cheese Marscapone"
- "5  to  6 shiitake mushrooms full"
- "1 shallot"
- "1 head garlic of"
- " Sherry"
- " Balsamic vinegar"
- " Salt  Pepper"
- " Parsley"
- " Swiss cheese optional"
- " Olive oil"
- " Butter"
- " Honey"
recipeinstructions:
- "Rinse and roughly chop shiitakes and place to the side"
- "Mince 1 shallot"
- "Separate each clove from the head of garlic (skin still on)"
- "On a piece of aluminum foil, toss the cut shallot and garlic cloves together with 1 1/2 to 2 tbsp. of olive oil and 1 tsp. of honey"
- "Cup the aluminum foil 1/2 way over the mixture and place in the oven on broil for 10 minutes or so. This ensures a crispy roasting time but depending on the temperature of your oven it could be more or less time"
- "In the meantime, take out your phyllo pastry shells and 1 tbsp. of butter. Once the butter is semi-soft, either use hands or a utensil to lightly coat the phyllo with a glistening light layer of butter. Lay the shells about a 1/4 inch apart on a baking sheet. Take out the marscapone from the fridge so it will be softer to spread!"
- "After the mixture is roasted and caramelized, allow the shallots to cool a bit while shucking the garlic! The garlic cloves will be warm so it will be simple to pop the garlic out (removing it&#39;s skin)"
- "Finely mince the garlic. In a bowl, gently combine the garlic, the shallots, and the shiitakes"
- "Add a pinch of salt and parsley to the mixture. Use a bit of black pepper (if your prefer). Stir in about 3 splashes of sherry and 1 splash of balsamic vinegar. Once tossed, place the mixture aside"
- "Taking care of the phyllo cups, use a spoon to gently glide a layer of marscapone on the bottom of each pastry. I only had to use about 1 tsp. (depending on the size of your pastry). The phyllo is delicate, so gentle is the key!"
- "Sprinkle a decent amount of parsley over the layer of marscapone"
- "Now is the time to add the filling! Scoop about a tbsps amount of the mixture into each cup, pressing down slightly towards the bottom. Keep piling the filling on top until each is completely filled."
- "Set your oven to 350 degrees and let cook for 20 - 30 minutes. If preferred, swiss cheese on top 1/2 throughout cooking time (it&#39;s even more yummy)!"
- "Remove from oven and let stand for 5 - 10 minutes"
- "Voila !"
