Hello everybody, hope you are having an amazing day today. Today, we're going to prepare a distinctive dish, roasted masala salmon asparagus and butter corns. One of my favorites food recipes. This time, I'm gonna make it a bit tasty. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

They're fine and they look fantastic. Roasted Masala Salmon Asparagus and butter corns is something which I've loved my whole life.

##### The ingredients needed to make Roasted Masala Salmon Asparagus and butter corns:

1. Prepare 5 piece Salmon Fish(cleaned and washed)
1. Get 2 tbsp ginger garlic paste
1. Prepare 4-5 garlic chopped
1. Make ready Handful spring onions (chopped)
1. Get 1.5 tbsp Butter or oil
1. Prepare 1 tbsp whole mustard sauce
1. Get 1 tbsp fish masala(any brand)
1. Make ready 1 tsp chilli powder
1. Prepare 1 tsp garam masala
1. Prepare 1 tsp coriander powder
1. Take 1 lemon juice
1. Get as needed Boiled Corns
1. Make ready 10-12 Asparagus (washed)


This flavor combination is always a winner with seafood (in my opinion). This simple fish dish is best made with wild salmon, but it works equally well with the farmed sort. In a hot oven, melt butter in a skillet until it sizzles, add the salmon, flip, remove the skin, then allow to roast a few minutes more. Roasted asparagus gets a leg up on the basic side dish with a drizzle of nutty browned butter and the crunch of buttery marcona almonds.
