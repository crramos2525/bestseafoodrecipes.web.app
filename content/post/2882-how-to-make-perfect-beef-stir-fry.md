recipeingredient:
- "1 lb. flank steak"
- "1 1/4 lb. broccoli 1 bunch"
- "1 red bell pepper"
- "1 1/2 inch square piece of fresh ginger"
- "4 1/2 tsp peanut oil can substitute vegetable oil"
- "4 cloves garlic"
- "5 tbsp oyster sauce"
- "3 tbsp chicken stock"
- "1 tsp sesame oil toasted"
- "1/4 cup brown sugar"
- "1 tbsp dry sherry"
- "1 tsp corn starch"
- " White rice"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put the flank steak in the freezer from anywhere between 10 minutes to 1 hour to toughen it before slicing it. Then, cut with the grain into 2 inch pieces, then cut perpendicularly into 1/8 inch thick slides."
- "Marinade the flank steak slices in soy sauce for at least 5 minutes, although 1 hour is preferable."
- "Cut the florets off the heads of broccoli. Halve them if they are larger than bite sized. Also, prepare the stem of the broccoli (white interior only), slicing on the bias into 1/8&#34; slices."
- "Prepare the red bell pepper by dicing it into 1/4&#34; square pieces."
- "Peel and grate the ginger using a fine zester, such as one from Microplane. Then, mince the garlic and add it to the ginger. Put 1 1/2 tsp of peanut oil in the mixture to prevent it from burning. Set aside."
- "Make the sauce by adding 5 tbsp of oyster sauce, 3 tbsp chicken stock, 1 tsp sesame oil, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1 tbsp dry sherry, and 1 tsp corn starch. Set aside."
- "Start cooking white rice."
- "Heat 1 1/2 tsp peanut oil to high heat in a non-stick skillet. Drain the beef from the marinade, and then cook half of the flank steak. Once cooked, set aside and add another 1 1/2 tsp peanut oil to the pan. Allow it to reheat and then cook the other half of the beef in a similar manner. Each side will take about 45 seconds to cook. DO NOT overcook the beef. You will cook it again later, and can always make sure it&#39;s more cooked through if you&#39;re worried, but you cannot go back."
- "Add 1 tbsp to a clean non-stick skillet. Wait for wisps of oil to appear, and then add the broccoli. Cook in the pan for 30 seconds. Then, add 1/3 cup of water to the pan, cover with a lid, and turn the heat down to medium. Cook for 2 minutes, or until tender (test with the tip of a knife). Once done, set aside on a paper towel-lined plate."
- "Add 1 1/2 tsp of peanut oil to a clean non-stick skillet on high heat, and wait until the oil gives off wisps. Cook the peppers until they start to soften (about 1 - 1.5 minutes). When you start to see flecks of brown, add the aromatics (ginger, garlic, and oil). Cook for another 30 seconds. Add beef, broccoli, and sauce into the pan. Cook it all together just to reheat the parts that have cooled. Serve with white rice."
