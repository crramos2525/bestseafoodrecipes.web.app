Spaghetti tossed with lemon juice and olive oil for the sauce and loaded with tuna, peas, olives and plenty of herbs. We love a cupboard raid meal for something quick. Among the three options here, Spicy Tuna Rice Bowl is my favorite because it is absolutely fuss-free. When you order a Spicy Tuna Volcano or Dynamite Roll at a sushi restaurant in the States, you can definitely expect some spicy mayo in it.
