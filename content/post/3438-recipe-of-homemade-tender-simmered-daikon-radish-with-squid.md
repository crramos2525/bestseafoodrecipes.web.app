- "In a pan, add a little salt (not listed) and water, and boil the daikon radish. Add the daikon radish before boiling. It should be cooked and translucent in about 20 minutes. It is better to boil in the water leftover from rinsing rice."

- "Add soy sauce and mirin and put on a small lid or a piece of aluminium foil that sits right on top of it, and simmer over low heat for 15-20 minutes. The flavors of the simmering broth here will soak into the daikon radish as it all cools down."
- "Calculate the cooking time including the cooling time, before cooking.  You would like to cool it for at least 30 minutes.  Flip the daikon radish over around halfway through cooling."
- "Warm it up before serving and enjoy. You can add and simmer the tentacles with it, deep fry, or toss into a salad."
