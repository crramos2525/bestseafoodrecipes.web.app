I am using tilapia for this recipe because it is also reasonably priced and it can be easily sourced almost anywhere in the world. My version of sweet and sour fish doesn&#39;t involve deep-frying. Here is what you need to do: Use kitchen paper to dry the fish completely. Coat it with a thin layer of corn starch. Sweet and Sour Fish is a very popular dish in China, and it&#39;s almost always served as a whole fish.
