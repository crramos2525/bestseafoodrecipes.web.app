- "Add the cornstarch mixture back to the broth, mix it in, and then simmer and stir to thicken, for about 20 minutes or so."
- "Mince the lobster meat, and then add it to the broth.  Don&#39;t add it sooner, else you may create rubbery meat bits."
- "Serve immediately, though it might still be a bit thin.  It will thicken by the next day, though.  If I had you add more cornstarch, it would be all congealed by the next day."
