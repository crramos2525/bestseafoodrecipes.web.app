- "Add the stir fried squid and beans into the curry mix and cook for 2-3 minutes with the lid closed. Adjust for any salt and pepper if required and a sprinkle of sugar. Boil off all the excess water with lid open, splash a little more oil if you don&#39;t mind to get a slight &#39;beginning to char&#39; effect. Finish off with dash of lime and serve hot."
