Oysters are two small, round pieces of dark meat on the back of poultry near the thigh, in the hollow on the dorsal side of the ilium bone. In French, this part of the bird is called sot-l&#39;y-laisse which translates, roughly, to &#34;the fool leaves it there&#34;. Tours of Matunuck Oyster Farm begin at Matunuck Oyster Bar with introductory discussion about aquaculture and fisheries on a global and local scale. Guests are then invited to visit the shellfish farm. Order your Oyster card travelcard, check Oyster card prices or top up Oyster Pre Pay.
