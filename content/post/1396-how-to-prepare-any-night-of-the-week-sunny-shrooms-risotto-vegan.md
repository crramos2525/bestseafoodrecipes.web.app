A flavorful and easy to make recipe. A vegan risotto can actually be much tastier than traditional versions with butter and cheese, as you&#39;ll need to add lots of extra flavors, such as a quality broth, and maybe some wine, mushrooms, spices or fresh herbs, rather than relying on a layer of Parmesan cheese for flavor. It&#39;s simple enough to make for a mid-week dinner, yet decadent enough for entertaining. And vegan or not, everyone will love this satiating bowl. The risotto is rich, thick and creamy, with garlicky and cheesy flavour.
