My husband requests mahi mahi drizzled with lemon butter (more like swimming in lemon butter) at least once a week. While I love lemon butter sauce, eating the same dish again and again gets old, fast! Throwing some shrimp on the grill and then brushing them with lemon butter is a quick and tasty way to cook these succulent shellfish. Set the shrimp skewers, basket, or plain oiled shrimp, on the hot grill. Brush with more of the lemon butter.
