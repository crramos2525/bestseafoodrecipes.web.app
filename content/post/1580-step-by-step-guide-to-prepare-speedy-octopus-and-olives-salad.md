- "1 jar olives chopped into pieces without the pip"
- " Oil"
- "5/6 juniper berries"

recipeinstructions:
- "In a large pan bring water to boil with the juniper berries broke in half, the bay leaves, salt and a drop of white vinegar"
- "When it boils drop the octopus in the water by submerging it first 3/4 times as per video below. As you can see tentacles start to curl immediately with the hot water."

You know that it’s ready when you can easily put a fork through the middle part of the octopus without needing force."
- "When ready remove it from the water and you can either simply chop it into pieces or if you want to remove some of the skin simply peel it out with your hands under cold water and then chop it"
