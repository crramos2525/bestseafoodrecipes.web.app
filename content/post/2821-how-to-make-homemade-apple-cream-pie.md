In a medium bowl, combine the apple butter, caramel sauce and apple pie spice and mix until well blended. Apple pie is an absolute must, and I know it&#39;s hard to shake tradition, but today I am sharing a completely swoon-worthy variation of the classic. This is Grandma&#39;s Creamy Apple Pie and I am telling you - once you try this, you will never go back to normal apple pie! There&#39;s just something about this creamy, custardy filling that makes. Brown sugar gives apple pies a caramel flavor that I adore so that needed to be subbed in as well.
