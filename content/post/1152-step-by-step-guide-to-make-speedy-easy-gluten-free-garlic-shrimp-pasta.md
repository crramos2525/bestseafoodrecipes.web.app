We used Angel Hair Rice Pasta for this dish, so delicious! I used to be a total pasta lover, but since going Gluten Free I haven&#39;t had much pasta lately. Awhile back I discovered Rice Noodles, to me it tastes just as good as regular. this garlic shrimp is an easy one pot dish perfect for an appetizer, side or to spoon over pasta. Tender and juicy shrimp are cooked in a garlicky and buttery sauce before being tossed with baby spinach and parmesan.
