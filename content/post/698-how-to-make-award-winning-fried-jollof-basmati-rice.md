recipeingredient:
- "4 cigar cups basmati rice"
- "350 mls tomatoes stew"
- "1/2 whole chicken"
- "1 teaspoon thyme 2 teaspoons curry"
- "to taste Onion knorr cubes salt"
- "4 tablespoons vegetable oil"
- "2 cups mixed vegetables Carrot peas cabbage sweetcorn"
- "1/4 cup chopped spring onion optional"
- "1 1/2 cups precooked shrimps"
recipeinstructions:
- "Pour the chicken stock and the tomato stew into a sizeable pot. If the mixture is too thick, add a very small quantity of water. Add pepper (pound or blend it first) and curry powder. Stir very well, cover the pot and cook till it boils."
- "Add the drained 2 cups of basmati rice, stir and make sure the liquid in the pot is at the same level as the rice. Cover the pot and cook on low to medium heat till all the water dries up. When you taste the rice, you will notice that it is still raw and hard to the bite. Please do NOT add more water to it."
- "Stir the rice with a wooden spoon. You can add more tomato stew before stirring if you think it is not red enough."
- "Turn off the heat, cover the pot with aluminium foil followed by the pot cover. Make it as airtight as possible so that no heat escapes. Leave it like that for 5 to 7 minutes, at most, 10 minutes. After that, open the pot, stir and you will notice that the rice is now well done, not soggy, has loose grains and it is tasty."
- "For Basmati fried rice: 2 cups basmati rice (washed) Place a large pot (with a good fitting lid) on medium heat; add 1 part each of oil, curry, thyme, 1 cube maggi, and 1 teaspoon of salt. Stir. Add in 3 cups water. Cover the pot, increase heat to high and bring the mixture to a boil."
- "Reduce the heat to medium-low (2.5-3), add in the rice and stir. Cover the pot tightly (I cover my pot with foil paper usually and then add on the lid) leave the rice to cook for 25 minutes. Set aside to cool"
- "Place another large pot on medium heat, add in the left over oil and heat slightly. Add all left over ingredients and cook for 2 minutes."
- "Add in the precooked rice, meat (if using) and 3 tablespoons water, combine. Taste and adjust for seasoning as needed. Simmer for another 3 minutes Serve and Enjoy!"
