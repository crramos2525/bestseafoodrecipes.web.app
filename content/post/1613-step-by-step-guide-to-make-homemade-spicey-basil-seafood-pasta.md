I don&#39;t think this dish is any easier than boiling pasta in one pot, and making a quick tomato sauce in another, besides one less pot to. I marinated the shrimp in olive oil, garlic, and fresh basil for a few hours while I simmered a simple and spicy basil marinara. I served the sauce over whole wheat penned then topped the dish with pan grilled shrimp.
