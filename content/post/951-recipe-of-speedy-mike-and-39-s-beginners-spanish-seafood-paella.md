recipeinstructions:
- "Seafoods required."
- "Paella Pan. It&#39;s important for the even cooking of your rice."
- "When I&#39;m making anything seafood related - I always make a basic seafood stock for later use that week. So, know that with this recipe - you&#39;ll have much more stock than you&#39;ll actually need. This recipe makes about 7 cups but you&#39;ll only need 3 cups total for this specific Paella dish."
- "Bring 8 cups water, a 1/2 cup white wine and a 1/2 tsp salt to a heavy boil. Add dethawed lobsters to boiling water [shells left on] for 1 - 1/2 minutes total. Remove lobster tails from stock with a slotted spoon immediately. Authors Note: Your lobster will be hard to pull from the shells since it&#39;s only blanched. But, no worries. You can always flake your lobster. In fact, it can go further that way."
- "Bring stock fluids back up to a steady boil. Add frozen shrimp - peels and legs still on - to boiling water. Once back up to a steady boil - remove shrimp from water with a slotted spoon immediately. Authors Note: You&#39;ll want your shrimp firm and pink with no fishy scent to them."
- "Bring water back up to a steady boil. Add frozen scallops to boiling water. Once back up to a steady boil - remove scallops from water with a slotted spoon immediately. Authors Note: If a scallop isn&#39;t white and is somewhat discolored - throw her out. She&#39;s icky!"
- "Allow your blanched seafood to cool on your counter before shucking or chopping. Do not refrigerate your seafood. Your cooking time will move pretty quickly so there&#39;s no risk."
- "While waiting - chop your vegetables."
- "Also, cold rinse your frozen, presteamed mussels. There may still be some sand in them. Pull any beards that may still be attached. Refrigerate clams/mussels. Know that they can go South pretty quick if not refrigerated."
- "Soak your rice in water. Fully drain after 15 minutes in a tight mesh strainer. Otherwise you&#39;ll have a soupy Paella. Paella should always be rib sticking thick and hearty."
- "Chop / shred your lobsters, shuck your shrimp - leaving on tails and halve your jumbo scallops."
- "Soak 2 large pinches of saffron in 2 tbsp of quality white wine to soften threads for 10 minutes. You&#39;ll love the color the saffron eventually lends to the wine! It&#39;s beautiful!"
- "In a large Paella pan or heavy skillet, heat 3 tbsp olive oil. At medium high heat - add your chopped hard vegetables - onions and bell peppers. Sauté for 8 minutes then add your FULLY drained rice. Fry for 3 more minutes uncovered. Stir regularly."
- "Add your minced garlic and 2 1/2 cups lobster / wine stock to pan. Reserve 1/2 cup to add if needed."
- "Add everything in the Herbs &amp; Seasonings section [except for fresh parsley] and everything else in your Vegetable section. Mix well."
- "Bring rice mixture to a boil and let the liquid reduce just slightly. Cover with a tight fitting lid or, tightly with tin foil and cook on low for 20 minutes. At 15 minutes in - add your fresh parsley and stir. Try not to peek during but, make sure she isn&#39;t burning."
- "Uncover pan and in this order - lay your blanched lobster, shrimp and scallops over the rice, pushing them into the rice just slightly. Add a little stock if needed. You&#39;ll definitely need some steam at this point. Cover tightly again and steam on low heat for another 5 minutes. At 3 minutes in - add your presteamed clams. Authors Note: If a clam doesn&#39;t open - throw it out. She&#39;s icky too!"
- "A decent, affordable pre-fabed Paella Kit to consider for ease in place of the Herbs &amp; Seasonings and Rice sections. Again, use only 1/2 of that seasoning packet included and taste test from there."
- "Garnish with fresh green onions, chopped parsley and lemon wedges. Lightly drizzle with garlic infused olive oil. Serve with fresh, warm French bread and a quality white wine. Enjoy friends!"
