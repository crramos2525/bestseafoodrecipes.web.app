I especially love frying them in some coconut oil because it adds just a touch of sweetness and some good fats. A quick coconut-spiked caramel sauce, featuring GOYA® Dulce de Leche, becomes a silky bath for GOYA® Plantains. If your grill is still hot from dinner, grill the plantains for smoky charred flavor. Or, cook plantains in a grill pan or skillet to infuse them with toasty cinnamon flavor before stirring them.
