- "1 to 2 handfuls Bean sprouts"
- "1 Thinly sliced pork or beef"
- "50 ml Dashi stock about the concentration for miso soup"

- "1 Vegetable oil"
- "1 Salt and pepper  A"
- "1 Tempura crumbs  B"
- "1 Bonito flakes  B"
- "1 Aonori  B"
recipeinstructions:
- "Cut the vegetables and meat into bite-sized pieces. *In this case, it&#39;s better to tear the cabbage by hand instead of cutting it into neat pieces."
- "Prepare the dashi stock, it can be dash stock powder dissolved in hot water. *Speed is essential, so prepare the sauces now too."
- "Take the noodles out of the refrigerator and place on a plate. Sprinkle sake over it and lightly cover with plastic wrap. *Microwave until the noodles are warm (it takes me about 1.5 minutes at 600 W)."
- "Many people warm the noodles in the bag, but a popular store told me it&#39;s better to prepare the noodles with the method in Step 3. This is essential!!"
- "Put vegetable oil in a frying pan, and heat over high. Put the meat in first and season with the A ingredients. When the meat is almost cooked through, add the vegetables. Season again with the A ingredients and stir-fry."
- "Once the Step 5 vegetables have softened up, add the Step 3 noodles (do not add sake on the plate). Add the Step 2 dashi stock, and untangle the noodles while cooking over high heat."
- "When the Step 6 noodles have untangled and about 90% of the dashi stock has evaporated, add the Step 2 sauce. Mix quickly and put on a serving plate."
- "In Step 7, make sure you mix the sauce with the remaining dashi stock that hasn&#39;t been fully evaporated. This is important!!"
- "From Step 6 onwards, the process up until plating should take about 20 to 30 seconds."
- "If you take your time here, the noodles will not only dry out, but start tasting like the instant kind."
- "After serving onto a plate, top with the B ingredients and it&#39;s ready. Adding mayonnaise or chili pepper powder to taste is also yummy."
- "Noodles that have dried out are never good. The sauce sticks well onto chewy noodles that have a slippery surface. This way, the noodles will taste exactly like what you&#39;d get at a restaurant."
- "I always use this type of sauce which is on the sweeter side. This company also makes &#34;Yakisoba Sauce&#34; but I like to use the &#34;Okonomi&#34; type."
- "But, if you can&#39;t find it, try using the&#34;Fake Otafuku type Okonomi Sauce&#34;."
- "I tried various types of sauce for this recipe before posting it. The amount needed is the same at 40 to 60 ml."
- "Always use thick noodles... Thin noodles will become soggy and mushy."
- "To make the noodles as yummy as those cooked at restaurant griddles, make sure to keep the frying pan or electric griddle on high heat."
- "The dashi stock added in Step 6 should evaporate if the heat is kept on high. This is an important point for keeping the noodles chewy."
