- "2 tbsp Soy sauce"
- "4 tbsp Water"
- "1 tbsp Sake or water if you dont have any"
- "1 dash Sesame oil"
- "1/2 tsp Grated garlic"
- "1 dash Kombu tea optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "I love marinated boiled eggs. I use this egg timer gadget I got at a 100 yen shop, If you don&#39;t have one, a watch or timer is fine too."
- "Put the eggs and the egg timer gadget (if you have one) in a pan, and add enough water to cover the eggs."
- "Turn the heat on to medium and keep it there. The water should boil to about the state in the photo."
- "In the meantime, make the marinade. Put the flavoring ingredients in a plastic container. The amounts are approximate, so you can just eyeball it. The ratio of soy sauce to water is about 1 : 2."
- "After boiling for 8 minutes, turn the heat off and leave for 2 minutes. If you&#39;re using the egg timer gadget, it should be at the &#39;medium&#39; line. Leave until the line becomes blurred."
- "Incidentally, I intended to use these eggs in bentos so I cooked them a bit longer than usual, but if you are going to eat them right away, take them out of the water after 8 minutes and don&#39;t leave for the additional 2 minutes. They&#39;ll be creamier in the middle that way."
- "Peel the eggs, and plop them in the plastic container. Turn the eggs to coat them in the marinade. (I didn&#39;t peel the eggs too well, so one is really bumpy..)"
- "When the eggs have cooled down, put the lid on the container and marinate the eggs for about 1 hour in the refrigerator. Turn them over whenever you think of it, using chopsticks."
- "Done! I make it before I go to bed and eat it the next day."
