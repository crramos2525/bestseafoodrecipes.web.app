I disagree with a previous review that squid takes forever to clean though - it is. Cantonese Salt and Pepper Squid recipe is similar to fried calamari but are tossed in a mixture of crunchy stir-fried garlic, ginger, and hot green peppers. Dredge your squid in the flour/spice mix. You can do this piece by piece, or just Serve your fried calamari hot, as soon as possible. If you haven&#39;t overcooked it the squid won&#39;t go.
