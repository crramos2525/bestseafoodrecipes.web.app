Also, I occasionally use it to make white rice that I&#39;ll use for fried rice. A good way to use up leftover stock! White asparagus, egg whites, white pepper and crab meat are traditionally used to elevate the elegance. When eating a Vietnamese rice dinner, it&#39;s not a complete meal unless you have a soup side dish, also known as Canh. One of the quickest and simplest Canh is ground pork with cabbage.
