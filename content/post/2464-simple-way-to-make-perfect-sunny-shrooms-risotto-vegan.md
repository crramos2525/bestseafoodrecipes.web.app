Top with vegan cheese, or add in some nutritional yeast for extra flavor, if desired. Since the star of this show is mushrooms, we use them in two ways. The first is to pulverize dried mushrooms into a powder (in the blender). It&#39;s a similar approach to what we use in our Creamy Vegan Ramen recipe, and it makes for the most savory, umami-packed stock. It might sound odd, but trust us: this method creates a much deeper, more mushroom-y flavor than what you&#39;ll find in store.
