recipeinstructions:

- "Note I think it depends on the quality (material) of the clay pot and how you adjust the heat, but there may be a case in which it burns a little."
- "I didn&#39;t want to stir-fry in a clay pot, so I used a frying pan. If you&#39;re using a pot other than a clay pot, it&#39;s easy to make if you place the other ingredients over the stir-fry from step 4 and pour soup over it."
- "Since the pork is flavored well and cooked through, it won&#39;t turn into wasted ground pieces but will stay delicious to be eaten."
