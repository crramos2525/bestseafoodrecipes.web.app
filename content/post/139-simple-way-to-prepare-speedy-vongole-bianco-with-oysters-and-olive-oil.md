- "Look at Takuno-san&#39;s easy way to clean oysters.  https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/148389-how-to-rinse-oysters-to-a-glossy-finish"
- "Put 3 L of water into a large pot and bring to the boil. Just before it comes to the boil add 2 tablespoons of salt (1% of salt to the water)."
- "The sodium content in the water from the pot in Step 3 is an important factor in deciding the resultant taste so measure the amount of salt precisely. After bringing the pot to the boil, keep it over a very low heat."
- "Put A ingredients into a cold frying pan. Place the pan over a low heat. Cook slowly to infuse the garlic flavour into the oil."
- "When it starts to bubble around and the garlic becomes fragrant, add the red chili before the garlic is golden brown."
- "Add the chopped oyster from Step 1."
- "When the Step 7 garlic is golden brown add the butter. Turn the heat to medium and add the rest of the oysters."
- "Add salt and pepper. Cover with a lid and steam the oysters, keeping the heat constant."
- "Meanwhile put the pasta in  and drain 30 seconds to 1 minute earlier than the package instruction says until al dente. Cook over a low heat."
- "If you boil the pasta cooking liquid vigorously the liquid will evaporate fast and the pasta will be salty."
- "[Note:] Do not boil the water vigorously before or after you put the pasta in."
- "Before the oysters are cooked through, add B ingredients and stir well. Measure the pasta cooking liquid with a measuring spoon and pour in."
- "After the oysters from Step 9 are cooked through turn off the heat. When you see the oysters are plump and the edges are shrunk the oysters are done."

- "[Note:] At Step 15 when the sauce starts to thicken turn off the heat. The sauce is emulsified."
- "To make the pasta dish with olive oil-based sauce the emulsion of the sauce is very important. You cook a small amount of pasta at home so you don&#39;t get enough starch in the pasta cooking liquid to emulsify the sauce."
- "By adding the flour it helps the sauce to emulsify. You will have a restaurant-quality sauce in this way."
- "I usually use a mixture of pasta cooking liquid and flour but here I used pasta cooking liquid, water and salt to moderate the salt taste."

- "After the pasta boils, drain the pasta and add it to the oysters from Step 15 (over low-medium heat)."
- "Sprinkle with coarsely ground pepper. Add more salt if necessary."
- "Sprinkle with Italian parsley. I like green onion with oysters so here I used green onion to garnish."
