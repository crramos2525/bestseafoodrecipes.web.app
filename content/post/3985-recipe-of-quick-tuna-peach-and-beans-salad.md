Not because I was hungryâ€”because I I&#39;ve always been a tuna salad sandwich fan (extra pickles and potato chips, please!), but when I&#39;m leaning into my regular work day lunches. The authentic version would call for tuna packed in olive oil, but I actually prefer water-packed tuna. The salad packs a lot of protein, not just from the beans, but also from the tuna, which is also an excellent. Once cool, tear into large pieces. Since there are so few ingredients in this simple salad, you&#39;ll want to use really good canned beans; lower-quality beans are mushy.
