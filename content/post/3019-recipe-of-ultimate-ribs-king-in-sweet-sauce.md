Top Chef winner Mei Lin slow-roasts these ribs in the oven until they&#39;re supertender; then she glazes them on the grill with a sweet and spicy sauce spiked with She also stirs the sauce into pulled pork, serves it with french fries instead of ketchup and mixes it with melted butter to toss with fried chicken. Both the sauce and the ribs can be made ahead, leaving just the grilling to be done at the last minute. I used a combo of Sweet Baby Ray&#39;s and some thai chile dipping sauce. After the ribs had simmered for an hour -- I agree onion, celery, etc. not necessary -- I let them sit in the braising liquid.
