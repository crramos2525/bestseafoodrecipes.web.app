##### The ingredients needed to make Tuna and bean salad:

1. Make ready 1 15 0z can of Great Northern beans rinsed and drained
1. Prepare 1 (5 oz) can of water-packed tuna
1. Make ready  Good dash chili powder
1. Get  Good dash of ground cumin

1. Make ready  Good dash of tajin clasico seasoning with lime
1. Prepare  Good dash of Dill
1. Take  Good dash of salt and pepper
1. Prepare  Light drizzling of olive oil


For my salads, I prefer an olive oil with a fruity instead of grassy taste. Purists would insist on imported Italian canned tuna fish for the Tuscan classic, but we think plain old tuna from the supermarket is just fine, too. Green beans, chunks of tuna, and white kidney beans are mixed with olive oil, lemon juice, and a bit of garlic. After a few hours in the fridge, this Italian I used albacore tuna and served on baby spinich as a salad.

Will make again when craving a different tuna salad. May try with kidney beans next. This classic Italian salad marries cooked white beans and oil-packed tuna for a protein-packed, pantry-friendly, light meal that&#39;s perfect for warm weather. The vinegar used to marinate the onions and the juice that the onions release in the process together form the base of the dressing for the salad. This Tuna and White Bean salad is mayo-free, but big on flavor.
