Some may think it too sweet by itself; however, this sweet Aburaage complements sushi rice very well. Let Aburaage soak in the sweet sauce long enough so that it absorbs as much flavor as it can.

Inari Sushi is a popular dish in Japan along with nigiri sushi (nigirizushi - hand-pressed sushi that you find at sushi trains). It is particularly popular among children. I mentioned in my post Quick Inari Sushi (Inarizushi) that there are two different shapes of Inarizushi - squarish oval shape and triangle shape. Prepare sushi rice ahead of time. Once we have the sushi rice prepared and cooled, open an inari tofu pocket and stuff a ball of rice inside.
