Stays crispy and chewy and I gave it a little extra browning. I wanted extra crispy tofu, however, so I coated the pieces with a thin layer of cornstarch before Once the tofu is done cooking, the DELICIOUS fried rice comes together super quickly in the same skillet. Add rice to skillet and stir to incorporate. Allow to sit undisturbed for a few minutes to brown. Press the tofu to drain excess moisture.
