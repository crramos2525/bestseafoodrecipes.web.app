Then I season it with olive oil, lemon juice, salt, pepper, dried oregano, fresh parsley and garlic (optional). Baby octopus are marinated in a spicy gochujang sauce and seared quickly on the grill. Tender, enjoyably chewy, not to mention a burst of flavor with every bite! I know that a lot of people are intimidated by octopus. Cut octopus into large serving pieces, brush it with half the olive oil, and sprinkle it with salt and pepper.
