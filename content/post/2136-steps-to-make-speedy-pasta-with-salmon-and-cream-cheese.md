recipeingredient:
- "250 g pasta penne or fusilli"
- "2 salmon fillets chopped into rectangles or cubes"
- "50 g cream cheese  eg Philadelphia Original or cream"
- "1 Courgette"
- "50 g grated parmesan cheese to serve"
- "1 tbsp olive oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Chopping the salmon fillets into rectangles or cubes is good. We&#39;re going to fry them slowly so they become soft. We&#39;ll want them to break apart when we stir them with the pasta. We&#39;ll also reserve a few chunks after frying for presentation purposes. I&#39;d suggest removing the skin too, although it can be nice to keep a few with the skin to put on top when serving."
- "Start cooking the pasta as per packet instructions. Tend towards al dente if you can"
- "Start frying the courgette on a pan with little oil. Wait until they&#39;ve softened. Then add the salmon. Fry the salmon slowly. Only a little browning. We don&#39;t want to sear it. Give it about 5 minutes. Ensure the salmon pieces are cooked throughout."
- "Once the pasta is done cooking, and once the salmon and courgette are done frying... Retain some of the pasta water in a mug. Drain the pasta and return it to the pot."
- "Mix the cream cheese in to the pot, making sure all the pasta is coated lightly. Add a little more if needed, but don&#39;t overdo it if you&#39;ve chosen a cream cheese that&#39;s on the stronger side."
- "Mix most of the salmon pieces into the pan. Keep a few salmon pieces aside for later. Mix the pasta so that the salmon breaks apart. At this point I usually add some of the reserve pasta water into the pot to loosen the pasta up a bit. Use your judgement."
- "Serve the pasta into two bowls, with a dusting of parmesan cheese on top. Add on top some of the reserved salmon pieces, for presentation. Some basil also looks nice, if you have some."
