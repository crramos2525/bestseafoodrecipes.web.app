recipeingredient:
- "150 grams Cabbage"
- "70 grams Plain flour"
- "1 one handful Bean sprouts"
- "1 Ikaten deep fried squid snack"
- "1 Salt and pepper"
- "3 to 4 slices Thinly sliced pork belly"
- "1 portion Yakisoba noodles"
- "1 Egg"
- "1 Spring onion"
recipeinstructions:
- "Cut out the core from the cabbage leaves. Roll 3-4 leaves and julienne. Julienne the core as well. Cut the ika-ten into bite sizes."
- "Mix the flour with 1.5 times the amount of water. The batter is quite runny, so that it&#39;ll easily spread on the pan."
- "Grease a pan with oil and reserve about 1/5 of Step 2&#39;s batter. Pour 4/5 of the batter to the pan and spread thinly into a 15-20 cm circle. It cooks quickly, so turn on the heat after pouring the batter."
- "Fry over medium to high heat and once the colour changes, sprinkle dried bonito flakes on top. Pile the cabbage, bean sprouts and ika-ten on top."
- "Season with salt and pepper and drizzle the rest of the batter from Step 2 (it works like glue)."
- "Top with 3 to 4 sliced pork belly and steam-cook the cabbage. Using a spatula, prepare to flip the okonomiyaki."
- "Cover with another pan on top and flip over. If the ingredients spill out, stuff them back into the okonomiyaki. Press lightly and cook."
- "Meanwhile, heat oil in the first pan and fry the yakisoba noodles. Add water to loosen and add the half of the powdered flavour packet that came with the yakisoba."
- "Carefully remove the okonomiyaki from the pan and slide on top of the noodles (you don&#39;t need to flip over). Adjust the shape and fry further."
- "Heat oil in the empty pan and crack an egg. Break the egg yolk and spread into a 15 cm circle. Slide the okonomiyaki and noodles from Step 8 quickly onto the fried egg and press gently."
- "When the egg is cooked through, remove the okonomiyaki from the pan. Cover a plate on a pan and flip over. Serve."
- "Top with the okonomiyaki sauce, mayonnaise, aonori seaweed, red pickled ginger and chopped spring onions."
