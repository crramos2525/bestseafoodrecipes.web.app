- "2 tbsp Vegetable oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Roughly mince the cabbage. Finely mince the core."
- "Finely chop the pickled red ginger."
- "Pour the batter onto the electric griddle at once. The okonomiyaki should be about 15-18 cm and 1-2 cm thick. Lay pork belly slices on top and cook for 2 minutes."
- "For tempura crumbs, buy at the deli section of the supermarket instead of using leftover crumbs you made previously. It&#39;ll result in better flavor."
- "Add 1 ladle of cake flour, 1/3 of the grated yam, 1/3 teaspoon of baking powder, and 1 ladle of kombu dashi stock to the tempura crumbs and mix together. It&#39;s best if the batter is a little thick."
- "Add cabbage, pickled red ginger, and egg to the batter and mix it by scooping up and down with a fork to incorporate air."

- "Flip the okonomiyaki over and cook for 5 more minutes. Steam emitting from the sides is proof that it is cooking all the way through. Do not press down."
- "Flip the okonomiyaki one more time. The pork belly slices should be nice and crispy. Leave it to cook for 3 more minutes."
- "Don&#39;t worry about spreading the sauce on carefully, just smear a generous amount."
- "Once you add lots of aonori and bonito flakes, it&#39;s done."
- "Okonomiyaki also tastes good with a squirt of mayonnaise on top."
