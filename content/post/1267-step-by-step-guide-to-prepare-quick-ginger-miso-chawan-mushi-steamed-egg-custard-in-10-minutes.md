- "1 egg"
- "150 ml water"
- "1/2 to 1 teaspoon miso"
- "1 tbsp sake"
- "1 tsp granulated dashi stock"

recipeinstructions:
- "Cut the tofu into 1 x 2 cm cubes and place in the gratin dish. Flavor with a bit of salt (not listed)."
- "Microwave unwrapped at 600 W for 1-2 minutes. Place in a strainer to drain the water, then return to the dish (this drains the tofu)."
- "Combine and mix the ☆ ingredients well. Add the egg and beat. Add the water to create the egg mixture."
- "Add the maitake mushrooms to the tofu dish together with the imitation crab, cut into 1 cm pieces."

- "Please cover with plastic wrap when you&#39;re microwaving during Step 5."
- "It will continue to cook with the residual heat, so if it&#39;s a bit loose that&#39;s just about right. Do not overcook it. It&#39;s not good at all if it becomes porous."
- "Topped with sesame oil and green onions. Try it if you like."
