In unit test, a test double is a replacement of a dependent component It means that the mock object verifies that it (the mock object) is being used correctly by the object. @Mock will create a mock implementation for the CustomerDao. @InjectMocks will inject the mocks marked with @Mock to this instance when it is created.
