A crab cake is a variety of fishcake that is popular in the United States. It is composed of crab meat and various other ingredients, such as bread crumbs, mayonnaise, mustard (typically prepared mustard, but sometimes mustard powder), eggs, and seasonings, particularly the cake is then saut√©ed, baked. I love having these for lunch with a nice side salad, or sometimes I&#39;ll even make a sandwich with them, or crab cake sliders, which are my all time favorite. These crab cakes are all about the crab. A little bit of mayonnaise, panko, and an egg keep it all together, and the bell peppers and scallions add some fresh flavor and texture.
