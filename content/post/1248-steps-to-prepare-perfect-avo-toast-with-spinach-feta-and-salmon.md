Hummus does not belong on avo on toast and this is the hill I will die on today. Some flakey smoked salmon, some creamy smashed avo ‚Äî these two are SOULMATES. It&#39;s like tricking you into thinking you&#39;re being healthy cause it&#39;s ~feta~ and it&#39;s ~crumbled~ ‚Äî but really, just admit you have a cheese. This recipe makes salmon preparation simple while still introducing a gourmet touch. Top with the second salmon fillet.
