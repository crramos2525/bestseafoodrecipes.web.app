recipeingredient:
- "400 grams White fish such as cod"

- "1 tsp each Soy sauce and  juice from grated ginger"
- "16 grams Cornstarch"
- "2 tsp of water and sake Water to dissolve the cornstarch"
recipeinstructions:
- "These are the ingredients. You can see one filet of fish in the photo, but I actually used 2 filets of fish (400 g)."
- "I used 2 kinds of fish and you can see the difference of the colour in this photo. Blitz the fish in a food processor."
- "Transfer the fish into a mortar (with pestle) bowl."
- "My mortar and pestle is small, so I ground the fish until smooth in 4 batches. This is a tiring job, but you will have  plump fish cakes by doing this process."
- "Add the sugar and salt and grind the mixture further. Add the cornstarch dissolved in water and sake, and stir in the wood ear mushrooms and carrot."
- "Add the soy sauce and juice from the grated ginger, and shape the mixture into balls. Personally, I believe the wood ear mushrooms and lima beans are essential."
- "Deep-fry the fishballs in the oil heated to 100-140˚C for 4-5 minutes. If you use fresh oil, you will have pale-browned fishballs. If the oil has been used many times before, they will be dark-colored."
- "It is done. Note: In the photo at Step 5, you can see a naruto sitting next to the fish cakes. I tried to make it for fun."
