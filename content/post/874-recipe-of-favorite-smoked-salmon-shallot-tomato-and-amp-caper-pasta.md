recipeinstructions:
- "Cook the pasta in salted water according to instructions timed to reach the al dente point ready for Step 5 below. Reserve 200 ml of the pasta, drain, add 1 knob of butter and keep warm."
- "Put 1 knob of butter and the olive oil into a deep saucepan or wok, bring to a medium-heat and cook the shallots for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally to avoid sticking.

- "As soon as the crème fraîche is well-heated (but not boiling), add the smoked salmon and stir all together quickly but thoroughly and sufficiently long (should need 1-2 minutes) to heat the salmon. Stir in some of the reserved pasta water if iI looks like it’s getting drier than you want."
- "Add in the pasta, stir well to ensure all is cooked through and serve in pre-heated pasta dishes."
