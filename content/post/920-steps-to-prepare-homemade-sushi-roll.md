- "Drain the rice and keep it to cool down completely"
- "Mix the sugar and Vinegar in a bowl"
- "To this solution add the cooled rice and keep fluffing the rice with a fork till the vinegar has coated the rice. Never try to compact down the rice in an attempt to get the rice sticky"
- "If the rice is looking moist, fan it to remove excess moisture (else, when you spread the rice on the nori, the nori will turn soggy and tear and the roll will not hold)"
- "Place the Nori (dried seaweed) on a sushi bamboo rolling mat with the rough side facing up."
- "Spread the rice in a thin layer covering the entire mat and press down, leaving a little gap at the edges. Do not try to put more rice than is necessary. (I know it&#39;s tempting to put that lil&#39; leftover rice, been there, done that. And it came out a bit messed up)"
- "Place your filling, I have just used crabsticks here. You could use cucumber, spring onions, asparagus, pickled carrots or anything that goes with it. The only thing to note is that try not to put more than 3 fillings at a shot, since otherwise the roll becomes too big to seal effectively."
