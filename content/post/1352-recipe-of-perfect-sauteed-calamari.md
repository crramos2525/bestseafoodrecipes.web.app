- "Prep the calamari. Leave the tentacles whole. I sliced the caps into strips, but cut them however you like."
- "Place garlic, basil, a few drops of lemon juice, and a pinch of salt in a blender."

Sautée for a moment, adding a pinch of salt along the way, and then add your calamari. Sautée briefly, then add tomatoes. Remove from heat, add a pinch of oregano and squeeze in the juice from your lemon half."
- "Adjust your seasoning and lay this out on a plate. Finish by drizzling some of the pesto over the top."
