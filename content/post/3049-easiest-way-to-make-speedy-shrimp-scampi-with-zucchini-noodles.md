I also sautéed the zucchini noodles for a few minutes before serving, but also love them raw! Classic garlicky shrimp scampi gets a low-carb makeover in this easy dinner recipe. Zucchini noodles, also known as &#34;zoodles,&#34; are a healthier alternative to traditional pasta--they mimic the texture of pasta while taking on the flavor of whatever sauce you serve them with. Make sure you salt and drain the zoodles, otherwise your final dish will be soupy and the flavor will be diluted. The zucchini noodles and lemon zest add a brightness that is missing from traditional shrimp scampi with regular pasta.
