Teriyaki king oyster mushroom provides a perfect solution to all these problems. Unlike traditional stir fried dishes, this recipe uses a flat skillet to grill the mushrooms until crispy, and then quickly braises them in a simple teriyaki sauce to add a rich flavor. Mushrooms are often skewered whole and gently grilled in yakitori restaurants, but I decided to see if I could up the flavor factor by alternately skewering slices of king oyster mushroom and slices of bacon, stacking the slices of mushroom on the skewers so that they ended up reassembling themselves.
