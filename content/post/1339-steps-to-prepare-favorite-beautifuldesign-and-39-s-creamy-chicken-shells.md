##### The ingredients needed to make Beautifuldesign&#39;s Creamy Chicken Shells:

1. Make ready 3 Boneless skinless chicken breast (cut in cubes)

I made this chicken and broccoli pasta much lighter than a traditional mac and cheese by using low-fat milk and no cream, using only a small amount of butter, and using reduced fat cheddar cheese. A creamy, cheesy, chicken filling accentuates these Creamy Chicken Stuffed Shells. Make a double batch to freeze for another time. The filling is a luscious cream cheese, chicken, mozzarella concoction, specked with green onion and an herbed seasoning mix.
