##### Instructions to make Prawns pasta:

1. Drop the pasta in boiling salt water (bring the water to a rolling boil to prevent the pasta sticking togather). Set a timer for 2 minutes lesser that the cooking time mentioned on the packet. Mine said 10 minutes so I set the timer at 8 mins.
1. In the pan used to fry the prawns add 2-3 tbsp of extra virgin olive oil. Add the garlic and the sardines. Turn on the heat to medium after dropping in the garlic.
1. Once the garlic starts to brown add the slit chillies and stir and break the sardines.

As the garlic begins to colour, add the prawns and sauté them for a minute. Add the white wine and tomato purée, and simmer for a couple of minutes. Grate the zest of the lemon and roughly chop the rocket. When the pasta is ready, drain it in a colander, reserving a little of the cooking water. Prawns and pasta are a no-brainer - Ilario Vinciguerra&#39;s Linguine with broccoli rabe and Sicilian red prawns and Daniele Usai&#39;s Spaghettone with red prawns and wild fennel are fine examples.
