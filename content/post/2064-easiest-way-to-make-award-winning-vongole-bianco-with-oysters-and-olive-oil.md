- "Put 3 L of water into a large pot and bring to the boil. Just before it comes to the boil add 2 tablespoons of salt (1% of salt to the water)."
- "The sodium content in the water from the pot in Step 3 is an important factor in deciding the resultant taste so measure the amount of salt precisely. After bringing the pot to the boil, keep it over a very low heat."
- "Put A ingredients into a cold frying pan. Place the pan over a low heat. Cook slowly to infuse the garlic flavour into the oil."
- "When it starts to bubble around and the garlic becomes fragrant, add the red chili before the garlic is golden brown."
- "Add the chopped oyster from Step 1."
- "When the Step 7 garlic is golden brown add the butter. Turn the heat to medium and add the rest of the oysters."
