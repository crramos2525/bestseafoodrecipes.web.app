recipeinstructions:
- "Mix marinade ingredients into a plastic bag or bowl, and cover, for 3-6 hours in the refrigerator."
- "Add a drizzle of extra Virgin Olive oil to a non stick frying pan or griddle pan, just enough so that the steak won&#39;t stick. Heat the pan to a medium heat so that the Tuna steak is nicely seared on the outside and pink (to your liking) on the inside. The Tuna Steaks must be very fresh for this dish, but bare in mind that the citrus slightly cooks the tuna whilst marinating."
