These tasty salted black beans are commonly mixed in some of Cantonese or Chinese cuisines. Research on these dishes that uses salted black beans: Mapo Tofu, Beef with Spicy Black Bean Sauce, Beef &amp; Peppers in Black Bean Sauce, and a whole lot more. Buy more to have enough to. But I altered it - I used six tortillas (plenty!) and doubled the beans and chicken.

Also I used the entire onion and bell pepper (it would&#39;ve just rotted in my fridge). These crowd-pleasing enchiladas are stuffed with a hearty filling of Mexican-spiced chicken, black beans, and tender bites of rice and kale (cooked together in the same pot for easy cleanup)â€”brought together with a bit of rich sour cream. Combine the chicken and black beans in a medium bowl; add half of the sauce mixture. I&#39;m not sure what my family enjoys more, the beer can chicken for Sunday dinner or the black bean chicken enchiladas on Taco Tuesday. Season with sea salt, chili powder, cumin, ground chipotle, black pepper, and cayenne pepper.
