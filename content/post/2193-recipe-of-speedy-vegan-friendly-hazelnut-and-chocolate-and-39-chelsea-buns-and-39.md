I&#39;ve never had a Chelsea bun before but compared to a &#34;sticky&#34; bun these were airy buttery and lightly sweet. I followed buddyglb&#39;s advice and swapped out I used buddyglb&#39;s adjustments and my chelsea buns turned out looking absolutely fabulous! I now make them on a steady basis (weekly) as many. Nothing beats a warm, sticky Chelsea bun fresh from the oven. These are drizzled with icing for an extra naughty treat.
