recipeinstructions:
- "Pictured is the bulk of what you&#39;ll need for 2.5 servings. If choosing to steam your own legs - steam with lemon, garlic and white wine. When you can smell your legs - they&#39;re done. The Dungeness Crab will take 7 to 8 minutes per pound if choosing to steam. More seafood was served but this was all my students could fit into frame."
- "Start your corn cobs. Add equal parts milk and water. Milk adds sweetness to corn. Add enough fluid to cover your corn. Also, add your butter. Bring to a boil and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes. Watch your pot as the milk can cause it foam up and overflow."
- "Make your marinade and coat all seafood generously with it. Not much is needed."
- "Scewer your Jumbo Shrimp, marinate and refrigerate. Also, add a few dashes of lemon pepper to your shrimp."
- "It&#39;s time to grill! Clean grill, spray with non stick spray and heat. Here you&#39;re only heating your King Crab Legs and Dungeness Crab. Try to keep your temp at 400¬∞ However, you&#39;ll be grilling your shrimp. Over direct heat, grill for 5 to 7 minutes turning occasionally until shrimp is pink on the outside and opaque on the inside.."
- "Gently heat your garlic Kerrygold butter."
- "Plate seafood hot with lemon wedges to the side with plenty of napkins."
- "Since you have all of your butters out at room temperature, consider serving fresh, warm crispy breads. Also, consider a honey butter. It&#39;s a great contrast to the saltiness of your seafood and other butters. I&#39;ve got a great honey butter recipe under my profile if interested. ‚ò∫"
- "Pull your top shells from your Dungeness Crabs and clean. Boil for two minutes."
- "A pulled and cleaned top shell from crab pictured."
- "The inside of your cleaned shell pictured that&#39;s been boiled for 2 minutes. You do have the option of leaving what we call, &#34;The Mustard,&#34; within the shell but, I warn you - you&#39;d better like the crazy taste of fishy if you do! üê¨"
- "Create your crab salad by chopping your vegetables and adding your other chilled ingredients. See recipe above. Mix well."
- "Pack your shell with your craby chilled rich goodness! Garnish with fresh parsley, fresh ground black pepper and lemon wedges Enjoy!"
- "Check this out. my students even bought their moms a special pink fragrant rose at the end of their meal. How stinking sweet was that?! I swear - so sweet I darned near got a cavity!"
