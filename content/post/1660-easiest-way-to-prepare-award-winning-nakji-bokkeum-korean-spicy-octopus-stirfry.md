recipeinstructions:
- "In a bowl, mix gochugaru, sugar, fish sauce, soy sauce, garlic, and ginger until it&#39;s a well incorporated paste."
- "Mise en place is really important for stir fry because the cooking goes fast, and you want all your ingredients handy."
- "In a large wok or saute pan, bring 2 teaspoons of oil up to high heat, then stir fry the octopus *just* until all the pieces turn opaque. Set aside in a large dish or platter. No need to salt the octopus if it hasn&#39;t been rinsed of the salt from the ocean water."
- "Keeping the heat on high, preheat 1 Tablespoon of oil in your wok/saute pan, and stir fry half your veg, just until they all get a bit of sear. (If this is the batch with your onions, onions *just* starting to turn translucent is a good indication of when they&#39;re ready.)  Season with just a pinch of salt and set aside with the octopus."
- "Repeat Step 4 with the rest of your veg."
- "Keeping the heat on high, put 2 Tablespoons oil in your wok/saute pan, and add your paste right after. Give it a good stir so the oil will lightly cook the garlic and ginger and caramelize the sugar in the paste. This should only take 15 to 20 seconds."
- "Keeping the heat on high, add the octopus and veg back into the wok/saute pan along with 1/4 cup water, and toss thoroughly until all the paste/sauce is well integrated with the octopus and veg.  That&#39;s it! Enjoy with a bowl of steamed rice. :)"
