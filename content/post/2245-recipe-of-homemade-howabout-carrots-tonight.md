But I love the Look of these long carrots on. Place carrots into a pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Drain and transfer carrots to a serving bowl. Bring water to a boil, cover pan, and reduce heat to simmer. Fresh young new carrots are much smaller (although juicer and better tasting) but they don&#39;t spiralize very well!
