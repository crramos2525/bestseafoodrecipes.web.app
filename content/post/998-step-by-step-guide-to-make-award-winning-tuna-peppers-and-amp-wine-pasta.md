recipeinstructions:

- "Add around 40 ml of the olive oil to the mix and turn the heat on at max power. Add all the black pepper, and mix everything. Be careful not to burn the mix, feel free to adjust the heat as you want."
- "While cooking the mix, boil water in another pot. When the water starts bubbling add about 2 and a half teaspoons of salt to it. Also, remember to open the tuna cans, because you will need to add them to mix later."

- "Depending on your taste you might want different textures for your pasta, I like to leave it &#39;al dente&#39;. Occasionally I take a bit out of the water and taste to check if it is ready. When it reaches the perfect state for you, turn off the heat and remove all the water from the pot."
- "Before mixing the pasta with the tuna &amp; peppers on the wok, add the left olive oil and wine (around 10 ml of olive oil and 30ml of red wine). Let the pasta cook on the wok for 1 minute at max heat."
