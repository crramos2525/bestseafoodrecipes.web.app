- "1 from 1 squid Fresh squid liver"
- "1 from 1 squid Squid legs"
- "20 cm or so  Japanese leek"
- "1/2 tsp Soy sauce"
- "2 tsp Sake"
- " To prepare the legs and liver"

recipeinstructions:
- "Cut the legs apart."
- "Remove and hard suckers. If you press down on the legs with your palm on a cutting board; it&#39;s easy. Cut the legs into even portions."
- "Rinse the legs, rub them with salt, and drain in a colander for a while."
- "Sprinkle the liver with salt and drain in another colander. This way the fishy smell will be removed. The liver breaks easily so handle it very, very gently."
- "While the legs and liver are draining, slice the leek thinly. Make a cup with the aluminum foil by pressing it into a cup or something. Flatten the bottom. Of course, you can use aluminum foil cups instead of making your own."
- "Rinse the legs and liver quickly, pat dry and put them inside the foil cup."
- "Add the soy sauce and sake, top with the leek. Place the foil cups on a grilling screen, and cook over low-medium heat. It&#39;s more atmospheric to cook over charcoal, but I just use a gas burner."
- "When it starts to bubble, break the intestines and mix everything together. It&#39;s done when the legs are cooked through!"
