##### Instructions to make Turkey and sausage gumbo:

1. Slowly stir in chicken stock.
1. Add all meat and vegetables and simmer on medium low heat for 1 1/2 hours.


Stir in green onions and parsley. Serve over rice, with hot french bread! Studded with turkey meat and andouille sausage, it&#39;s filling enough on its own.
