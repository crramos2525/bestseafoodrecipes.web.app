- "Melt butter on medium-low heat and place inner side of the bun on top. You may slightly move it around to allow bread to absorb the butter."
- "Spread butter on the side that is facing you to prepare to grill it. Once the bottom is golden brown, flip the bread. Toast the buns until golden brown on both sides."
- "Divide the lobster salad evenly and fill the buns."
