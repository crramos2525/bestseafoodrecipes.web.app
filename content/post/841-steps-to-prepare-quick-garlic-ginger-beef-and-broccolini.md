recipeinstructions:
- "Prepare your marinade by getting your wet ingredients into a bowl. Add the dry ingredients and whisk vigorously. Dump into a large freezer bag along with beef. Marinade at least 2 hours. Turn the bag over half way through. I don’t know if there is science behind it, but it makes me feel better."

- "Cook the beef on a Med-High setting for about 3 minutes on one side and 2 minutes on the other. Use your judgement."
- "Boil the broccolini for about 3 minutes to get the bitterness out. Immediately submerge in cold water."
- "Get the chilli oil hot with the garlic and ginger. Add in the broccolini. Heat it with the fish sauce and seasonings. Pan fry until fork tender, but leave a little crunch."
- "Drizzle a little of the reduced marinade on the beef. Serve with white rice."
