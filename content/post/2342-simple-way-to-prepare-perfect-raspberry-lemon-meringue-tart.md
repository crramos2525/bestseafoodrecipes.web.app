- "Stir in yolks, butter and rind and allow to cool slightly. Spoon small amount of raspberry purée into prepared cases followed by the lemon curd, levelling top. Chill until firm."
- "To make the meringue, in a clean, dry bowl, using an electric mixer, beat egg whites until soft peaks form. Gradually add sugar, one tablespoon at a time, beating until sugar dissolves and foam is stiff, thick and glossy."
