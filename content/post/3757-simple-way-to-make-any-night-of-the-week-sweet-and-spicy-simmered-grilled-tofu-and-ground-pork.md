Try combining it with a little bit of this and that and do magic. Mabodon (Tofu and Minced Pork in Spicy Sauce). Mabodon is one of those dishes that looks complicated but really isn&#39;t. My take on mabodon has less minced pork than is usually suggested and more vegetables to make it light and healthy.
