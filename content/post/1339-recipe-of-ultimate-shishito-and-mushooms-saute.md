In a bowl, add ground beef, egg, salt and pepper. Green Shishito chile peppers are best suited for lightly cooked applications such as blistering, grilling, sautéing, and roasting. When cooked, the pod&#39;s peppery taste develops a richer flavor and becomes slightly smoky, which complements salty and savory sauces. Sauteed mushrooms with a hint of wine and teriyaki sauce are the perfect topper for steak and baked potatoes. I used sliced baby bella mushrooms and insteaf of using garlic salt, I used Penzey&#39;s Shallot Salt.
