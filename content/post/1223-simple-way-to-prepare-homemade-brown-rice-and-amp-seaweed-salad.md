Brown Rice is a whole-grain rice with the inedible outer hull removed. White rice is the same grain but has the hull, bran layer, and cereal germ removed. Red rice, gold rice, and black rice (also called purple rice) are all whole rices, but with differently pigmented outer layers.

##### The ingredients needed to make Brown Rice &amp; Seaweed Salad:

1. Get  brown/wild rice (I used barley and millet)
1. Make ready  water
1. Make ready  pumpkin seeds
1. Get  soy sauce
1. Prepare  spring onions
1. Get  finely sliced pickled sushi ginger or grated fresh ginger
1. Get  mirin or lemon juice
1. Prepare  sesame oil
1. Take  oil
1. Make ready  soy sauce,
1. Get  salt and pepper
1. Make ready  sliced nori (seaweed sheets)

The process that produces brown rice removes only the outermost layer, the hull, of the rice kernel and is the least damaging to its nutritional value. The complete milling and polishing that converts. Slow and low is the way to go. Yes, it takes a little longer than white rice, but it&#39;s not any harder.
