Place it on a baking sheet seam-side down and cover with a damp towel. Repeat with the remaining wrappers and filling, adding more water to the pie dish as needed. You can add some edible flowers ie pansy on too to make them look pretty."
- "Serve: To serve, cut each roll in half crosswise if desired and serve with sweet chilli sauce or A-jard sauce and some fresh vegetables and herbs"
