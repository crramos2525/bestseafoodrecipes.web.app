Bake the salmon and broccoli together, then serve in a bowl with rice &amp; veggies. This recipe is for the fresh salmon version-but I&#39;ll include my cheaters versionusing frozen filets-for those nights you want salmon-but don&#39;t have much time. The I recreated this from a dinner I had at Perkins one night. It&#39;s a lemon peppered filet that is then glazed with teriyaki sauce (so yummy!!!) This Teriyaki Glazed Salmon is the first recipe I tried using the Silpat Entremet. I love the way the teriyaki glaze caramelizes as it bakes, but it is really sticky and difficult to clean off a naked baking sheet.
