recipeingredient:
- "200 grams Cabbage"
- "100 grams Plain white flour"
- "1  Egg"
- "150 ml Water"
- "4 tbsp  Grated nagaimo yam"
- "1 tsp Soy sauce"
- "1 tbsp  Mayonnaise"
- "2 tbsp  Bonito flakes"
- "1 tbsp  Tiny dried shrimp"
- "1 The additions Thinly sliced pork belly squid shrimp"
recipeinstructions:
- "Chop up the cabbage into 5 mm square pieces.  It&#39;s quicker to chop in a food processor, but this tends to make the cabbage too watery, so it&#39;s best to hand-chop it with a knife."
- "Mix all the ＊ ingredients together. Mayonnaise is used to add a little oil to the batter, which makes it easier to mix. The bonito flakes and tiny dried shrimp are for adding extra umami."
- "Add the flour to the mix gradually, in about 3 portions, mixing between each addition. Coat the chopped up cabbage with additional flour, besides the cupful used for the batter."
- "Just before you&#39;re going to cook the okonomiyaki (this is important!) mix the batter and cabbage together. Mix up the batter from the bottom using a large spoon about 30 times, while incorporating air into it."
- "Heat some oil in a frying pan over medium heat, and pour in about 1 and 1/2 ladles of batter in. Top with the additions of your choice, and steam-cook with a lid on both sides."
- "Don&#39;t press down on the okonomiyaki with a spatula while you&#39;re cooking it.  For the cooking oil, use some oil you previously used for tempura if you have it. It should add flavor."
- "I used an Osaka area sauce called Kinmon sauce and Japanese Worcestershire sauce in equal amounts. &#34;Carp sauce&#34; from Hiroshima is delicious too."
- "In Kansai, white rice is a must with okonomiyaki. We eat the okonomiyaki with it as a &#39;set meal&#39;.  I used reduced calorie mayonnaise here.  You can add tempura batter crumbs (tankasu) to the batter if you&#39;d like."
