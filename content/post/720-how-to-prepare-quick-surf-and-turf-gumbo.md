recipeingredient:
- "4 pds sausage"
- "1 whole large chicken"
- "2 c lump crab meat optional"
- "2 packets dried shrimp optional"
- "1 large onion"
- "1 bell pepper"
- "3 stalks celery with leafy ends"
- "8 cloves garlic"
- "3 knorr chicken bouillon cubes"
- "1 tbsp salt at least"
- "1 tbsp pepper at least"
- "1/2 tsp cayenne pepper"
- "1/2 smoked paprika"
- "4 bay leaves"
- " For the roux"
- "2 cups flour"
- "1 3/4 cups vegetable oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Place chicken in large pot, cover with water and bring to boil, lower heat and simmer for 45 minutes. If you boil a chicken too aggressively the meat will be tough. Low and slow yields a more tender meat. When chicken is done remove from pot and set aside (lightly covered). Skim broth and remove any bits of fat or bone. Set aside for later use."
- "Dice all of your vegetables and place in a large bowl together. Set aside."
- "If you are using a sausage with high fat content (such as pork), you want saute them until grease is brought out and set aside on some paper towels (underneath and on top) to drain. I use venison, which is a very lean sausage, so I skip this step."
- "In small pot, cover 8 eggs with one inch of water and bring to boil,cook for 7 minutes then place eggs in ice water bath. When cool, peel and set aside."
- "In a large Dutch oven, heat your vegetable oil on medium high. When it begins to ripple, drop a little bit of your flour onto it. If it immediately begins frying, your oil is ready. Add your flour 1/2 cup at a time and stir into oil until all has been used. Lower heat to medium low and stir continuously until roux is the color of milk chocolate. This takes time! Sometimes I am stirring my roux for up to 40 minutes. Store bought roux is available if you want to skip this step, I don&#39;t recommend"
- "Add all of your vegetables to the roux and continue to stir for one minute."
- "Add the broth from your chicken and add water until it reaches 9 quarts. Raise heat to high. Your roux will not incorporate into broth until it starts to boil. Stir occasionally until this happens."
- "Add your sausage and shrimp to boiling pot. Bring to boil again, then lower heat to simmer for 30 minutes."
- "Add crab meat and eggs. Simmer for 10 more minutes."
- "While gumbo is simmering, debone the chicken, add to pot and stir gently. Take pot off of heat and let it sit for 8 minutes, covered."
- "I serve mine over rice with potato salad on the side."
