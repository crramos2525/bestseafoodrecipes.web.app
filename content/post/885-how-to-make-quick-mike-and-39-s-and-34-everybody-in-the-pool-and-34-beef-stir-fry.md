- "Now add all of your steamed veggies to the Wok and stir quickly. Cook for an additional 3 minutes stirring regularly."
- "Remove from heat and serve atop rice, with soy sauce and chopsticks. If cooking with Sesame Oil, there&#39;s really no need for Sesame Seeds to garnish your dish with."
- "Since I have two super picky eaters in the house, I was unable to put baby corn, water chestnuts, bamboo or snap peas in this specific dish but you certainly can!"
- "For the rice, prepare it the way the manufacture recommends. Usually, you&#39;ll rinse your rice until the water isn&#39;t cloudy then bring 1 cup of rice to 2 cups of water to a boil and turn down. Keep lid on tight for 15 minutes and do not stir. Remove from heat and let it stand with the lid on for 5 more minutes undisturbed."
