The squid will lose its flavor if submerged in water too long. Steaming the squid briefly works well too. For the seasoning, I first make chili oil by mixing gochugaru (Korean red chili pepper flakes) with heated oil. Then, add gochujang (Korean red chili pepper paste) and other ingredients, and bring everything to a boil only up until it. At Momo restaurant, I also tried Gae Jang Baek Ban (Spicy Raw Crab) for the first time.
