recipeingredient:
- "1.5 kg crab apples"
- "500 g rosehips"
- "1.2 litres water"
- " Approx 900g granulated sugar"
recipeinstructions:
- "Wash the crab apples and roughly chop. Don’t peel or core the apples as this part of the fruit contains valuable pectin. Wash the rose hips and use a food processor to blitz them. Place the chopped apples and blitzed rosehips in a large heavy pan and add the water."
- "Simmer until the fruit is soft and mushy - at this point use a potato masher to extract all the juice and pulp from the softened crab apples."
- "To make a successful, clear and colourful jelly the juice needs to be extracted from the pulp by allowing it to slowly drip through a scalded ‘jelly bag’ or muslin cloth. Don’t be tempted to squeeze the juice through as this will make the jelly cloudy. Allow the pulp to drip overnight."
- "Measure the juice and for every 600ml of liquid weigh out 459g sugar. Bring the juice to the boil and add the sugar. Stir in the sugar and bring back to boiling and boil rapidly until setting point is reached. You can test this by using the traditional cold saucer method."
- "Pot into clean, sterile jars and seal. Enjoy!"
