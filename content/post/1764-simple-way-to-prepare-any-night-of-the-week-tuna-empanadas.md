recipeinstructions:
- "Crust. Mix the flour and salt together in a large bowl. Add the butter and shortening."
- "Measure 1/2 cup (120ml) of water in a cup. Add ice. Stir it around. From that, measure 1/2 cup (120ml) of water– since the ice has melted a bit. Drizzle the cold water in, 1 Tablespoon (15ml) at a time, and stir with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon after every Tablespoon (15ml) added. Do not add any more water than you need to. Stop adding water when the dough begins to form large clumps."

Flatten each half into 1-inch thick discs using your hands."
- "Wrap each tightly in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour."
- "When rolling out the chilled pie dough discs to use in your pie, always use gentle force with your rolling pin. Start from the center of the disc and work your way out in all directions, turning the dough with your hands as you go. Visible specks of butter and fat in the dough are perfectly normal and expected!"

- "Fill your pie with the tuna filling about 3 tablespoons of the tuna on one side of your crust then add cheese. Then fold sealing the sides using fork."
