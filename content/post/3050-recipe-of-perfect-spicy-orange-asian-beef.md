I scaled it to three servings, and cooked gravy beef for two hours. I did everything as you said, except I added a little more garlic. To avoid the bitter pith underneath the orange&#39;s skin, use a vegetable peeler or zester to remove just the Bought the least expensive stew meat on sale, and still got a very tender &amp; flavorful Asian-style beef. Savoury, fruity, slightly sour and refreshingly spicy, orange beef stir-fry is a comforting dish that can be easily prepared in your own kitchen.
