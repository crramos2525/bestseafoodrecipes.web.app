recipeingredient:
- "6 beef short ribs"
- "1 large onion sliced"
- "6 cloves garlic roughly chopped"
- "2 tbsp fish sauce"
- "8 cups beef stock"
- "2 bay leaves"
- "6 tbsp peanut butter smooth or crunchy your choice"
- "1/2 lb green beans ends trimmed"
- "1 bundle kale destemmed and cut into large strips"
- "1 tbsp sauteed shrimp paste optional"
- "1/2 tbsp white vinegar optional"
- "1/2 tbsp maple syrup optional"
- "1 Serrano chili chopped optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "Season the ribs lightly with salt and pepper, then sear them in a large pot on high heat with a splash of veg oil. Once they&#39;re browned, remove them to a bowl and set aside."
- "Add the onion and garlic to the pot and fry for one minute. Add the fish sauce and let cook another minute. Add the beef stock and bay leaves and return the ribs to the pot (along with any juices). Turn the heat down to low, cover and let simmer for 2 hours. Be sure to skim the surface regularly because the ribs will give off a lot of oil and floaty gunk (sorry, don&#39;t know the right term for it)."
- "Once the ribs are soft pull them aside and let them cool. You can keep the pot simmering uncovered so the broth can reduce. When the ribs are cool enough to handle, clean the meat off the bones. Try to keep the meat as intact as possible. Remove the bay leaves from the pot and add the meat back in."
- "Stir the peanut butter into the pot. Once it&#39;s melted in, add the green beans and kale. Let simmer for 10 more minutes then serve with rice and shrimp paste (optional, step 5)."
- "In a small pot on low heat, add the shrimp paste, vinegar, maple syrup, and chili. Let it warm through, then serve on the side."
