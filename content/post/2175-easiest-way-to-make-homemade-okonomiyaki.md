- "While waiting for the batter to set, prepare the sauce.  In a small bowl, combine everything together.  Set aside in the fridge until ready to use.  After 1 hr, prep the batter."
- "Add in tenkasu, ginger and eggs.  *If you can&#39;t find tenkasu, you can simply just deep fried up some batter. Tenkasu is just tempura scraps or leftover.*  Mix until well combined.  Lastly fold in the cabbage and Shichimi Togarashi until fully incorporated."

- "Once bottom is lightly charred, flip onto serving plate.  Brush the sauce onto the okonomiyaki.  Sprinkle nori flakes over the top.  I dislike my okonomiyaki with lots of mayo, so I just dollops them over the top."
- "If you prefer, you can squeeze mayo all over the top in a zig-zag motion.  Lastly, sprinkle some bonito flakes and scallions over the top.  Repeat the steps for the remaining okonomiyaki.  Serve immediately and enjoy how the bonito flakes dance."
