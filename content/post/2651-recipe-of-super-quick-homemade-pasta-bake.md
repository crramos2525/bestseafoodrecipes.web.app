- "add this to a oven proof dish a pie dish or square dish is fine. leave a gap at the top couple of millimetres just so there is enough room for the cheese without it over flowing."
- "Finally grate some cheese on the top i tend to go with less is more idea as you dont want to drown the dish in cheese but again its your perferance as to how much cheese you add."
- "Bake in the oven on a medium heat about 180 should do it as all your doing is elting the cheese and giving it a golden look. once done take out and serve."
