recipeinstructions:
- "Boil a large pan of water and add the crab. Cook for 20 - 30 minutes then remove from the pan and let the water drain out of the crab by propping it up head down"
- "Once the crab has cooled, twist off the legs where they meet the body, pull off the claws and separate the body by placing it on it&#39;s back and placing your hands under the edge and pushing upwards until it breaks. You&#39;ll possibly need a knife to lever it"

- "Break off the outer edges of the crab shell to form a dish for serving the meat"
- "Spoon the meat back into the shell to serve and accompany with some good quality mayonaisse, brown bread, a wedge of lemon for squeezing over the meat and a little parsley"
