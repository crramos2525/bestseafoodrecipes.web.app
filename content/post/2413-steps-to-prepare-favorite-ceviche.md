Sea bass ceviche with avocado cream and spring onion fritters. by Matt Tebbutt. Ceviche (pronounced &#34;seh-VEE-chay&#34;) is a Latin American recipe for raw fish and seafood marinated in citrus juice, mainly lime and lemon. The acid in the citrus denatures the proteins in the fish, causing it. Ceviche, also called cebiche or seviche, is one of the dishes that I enjoy having in summer, even I had tried ceviche in different regions of Mexico, and the basics always apply: Fish, onion, tomato.
