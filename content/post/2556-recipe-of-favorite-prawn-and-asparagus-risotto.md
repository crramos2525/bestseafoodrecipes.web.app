- "When the rice is cooked, the risotto should still be slightly soupy – test by drawing draw the spoon through it and looking for a wake that holds for a few seconds."
- "When you are there, add the prawns/shrimp, chilli, lemon juice and zest, the remaining butter and a handful of Parmesan. Stir through, on the heat, adding another half-ladle of stock if needed to keep the creamy texture."
- "Let the risotto stand for a few minutes, then ladle on to warmed plates, top with the asparagus heads, a scattering of fresh dill, and a little more Parmesan. Serve with lemon wedges for squeezing over."
