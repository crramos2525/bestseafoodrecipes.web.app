recipeingredient:
- "80 grams Pasta I used linguine"
- "40 grams Crabmeat such as spider crab"
- "1 tbsp Olive oil"
- "1/2 clove Garlic"
- "2 tbsp White wine"
- "150 grams Tinned whole tomatoes"
- "1 Salt"
- "50 ml Double cream"
- "4 Basil leaves"
- " Pasta cooking water"
- "1000 ml Hot water"
- "8 grams Salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "Separate the crabmeat into small pieces. Chop the basil leaves into 5 mm dices. Crush 1/2 the garlic with the back of your knife. Boil the water to cook the pasta."
- "Remove any tough part and skin from the tomatoes and squash roughly."
- "Pour in the olive oil and garlic into a cold frying pan and place the pan on a low heat. Infuse the oil with garlic."
- "Once the water has boiled, add the pasta. Stop cooking one minute before the package instructions."
- "As soon as the garlic turns golden brown, remove it. Add the crabmeat and fry. Add the white wine and increase the heat to high to evaporate the alcohol."
- "After the alcohol has evaporated, add the tomatoes and salt. Once the sauce has boiled, turn the heat to low and reduce the sauce by 1/2. By cooking the sauce, it rounds out the tartness of the tomatoes."
- "After the sauce has reduced by 1/2, season lightly with salt. Turn off the heat."
- "Turn on the heat just 1 minute before the pasta has cooked. Add the double cream and basil leaves. Stir well."
- "As soon as the pasta is cooked, transfer the pasta to the sauce without draining. Mix together and continue to cook over low heat to coat the pasta with the sauce."
- "If the sauce has reduced too much, add the pasta cooking liquid. Check the taste and season with salt, if necessary. Transfer onto a serving dish and garnish with basil leaves."
