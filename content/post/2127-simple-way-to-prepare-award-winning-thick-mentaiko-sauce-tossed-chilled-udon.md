Mentaiko are salted fish roes, usually from either pollock or cod, and often come lightly spiced with Japanese chilli. These delicate, briny eggs I like to combine finely shredded strands of refreshingly sharp shiso leaves within my mentaiko sauce to give the rather creamy, indulgent sauce a bit of a lift. Mentaiko kimchi udon is one of my noodle obsessions. If I see it on a menu-which is rare-it&#39;s a must order. Chewy, toothsome noodles tossed with creamy.
