- "2 salmon steaks"
- " Sesame oil"
- " Chinese 5spice"
- "1 or 2 red or yellow peppers sliced"
- "1 or 2 red onions finely sliced"
- "1 or 2 carrots peeled and cut into thin batons"

- "2 handfuls baby spinach roughly chopped"
- " Thai fish sauce"
- "4-6 tablespoons soy sauce"
- " juice of half a lemon and wedges for serving"
- " fresh mint chopped"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the grill. Put the salmon steaks in a grill pan, I line it with foil to save washing up. Drizzle some sesame oil over the top and sprinkle generously with the 5-spice mixture. Place under a hot grill until crisp on the top and just cooked inside. This will only take 6 to 10 minutes."
- "Once the salmon is cooked, flake it into chunks and peel off and discard the skin, pour over a little shake of soy sauce and lemon juice and set aside."
- "Start to fry all the vegetables, if you have a wok you can probably do them all in one go, in a frying pan it might be better to do them in batches. Don&#39;t fry for too long, everything needs to keep some crispness and texture. When the peppers are just beginning to char at the edges, add the ginger, garlic, lemon grass and shrimp paste. Stir until you can smell the fragrances, then tip the vegetables on to a plate."
- "Quickly return the pan to the heat and fry the cooked rice and the cashews, then return the vegetables to the pan, stir in the chopped spinach, add 2 or 3 teaspoons of fish sauce, depending on how much you like it, and  3 to 4 tablespoons of soy sauce. Stir until the spinach has wilted then add the salmon chunks and the juice of half a lemon. Taste. Add more soy sauce or lemon juice to taste."
- "Serve piled in bowls, topped with fresh mint."
