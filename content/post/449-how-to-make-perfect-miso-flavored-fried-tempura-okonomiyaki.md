- "1 Egg"
- "30 grams Cabbage"
- "1 heaping tablespoon Sakura shrimp"
- "1 tbsp Red pickled ginger"
- "2 tsp Vegetable oil"
- "1 tbsp Miso"
- "1 Ingredients meat octopus squid corn tuna etc"
- "2 Green onions or scallions"
recipeinstructions:
- "Add ◎ to a bowl and mix it up with an egg beater instead of sifting, add the dashi stock broth a bit at a time, and mix without kneading. Dry-fry the sakura shrimp."
- "Add 1 cm squared cabbage, sakura shrimp, red pickled ginger, any of your favorite ingredients, and a cracked egg to the bowl from Step 1. Gently mix it up with a fork or cooking chopsticks."
- "Heat oil in a pan, and cook over medium heat. Once the sides have hardened, flip over. Press down firmly on it with a spatula, and lightly coat the top with half of the miso."
- "Flip it over and reduce to low heat. Press down on the batter with a spatula, and lightly cover with the remaining miso."
- "Flip it over again, and it is done once you fry the miso. You cook it through on both sides, coat with miso, and fry it again over low heat."
- "Garnish the fried okonomiyaki with scallions. Top with mayonnaise if you like.  However, please first try a bite with just the simple taste of miso."
- "Variation: Add 1/2 teaspoon of curry powder roux for faint flavor of curry. It goes better with the sauce. I recommend making it with green onions and corn."
