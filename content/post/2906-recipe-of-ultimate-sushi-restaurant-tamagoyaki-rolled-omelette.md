- "3 Eggs"
- "2 tbsp Water"
- "1/2 tsp Dashi stock granules"
- "2 tbsp Sugar"
- "1 tbsp Mirin"
- "1 dash Salt"
- "1 dash Soy sauce"
- "1 Vegetable oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Mix all the ingredients together (except the oil) very, very well.  Keep the tips of your cooking chopsticks on the bottom of the bowl when you mix, and try not to introduce air bubbles. Mix well to whisk the egg whites properly."
- "Spread oil in a frying pan and heat. Wipe excess oil with paper towels. I added some tips for adjusting the heat level in Hints."
- "Press the bottom of the pan on a tightly wrung out moistened wadded up kitchen towel to even out the heat."
- "Spread a bit less than 1 ladleful of the beaten egg in the frying pan, and spread it around the whole pan. If any air bubbles form, pop with chopsticks."
- "When the surface is soft set, fold it into thirds using chopsticks."
- "Push the folded egg to the far side of the pan. Spread some oil in the open space of the pan using the oil-soaked paper from Step 2. Press the bottom of the frying pan on the moistened kitchen towel again as in Step 3."
- "Pour in some beaten egg as in Step 4. Hold the rolled egg up a bit and tilt the pan to let the uncooked egg flow under it."
- "Repeat Steps 5 to 7 until all the beaten egg is used up."
- "Wrap the cooked tamagoyaki in a sushi rolling mat and leave it as-is for a while. The tamagoyaki is done. If you match up the edges of the mat to the corners of the tamgoyaki when you wrap it, the surface will have a clean spiral."
