It was a little tricky to make because my pan was on the small side for it. definitely tastier than the restaurant version (my first encounter with mee goreng). Lots of fresh vegetables, a little minced mutton and high heat. A dish with just a touch of the desired flavourful burnt. Served with a side dish of fresh cucumber and tomato sauce. hmm . heavenly!!!
