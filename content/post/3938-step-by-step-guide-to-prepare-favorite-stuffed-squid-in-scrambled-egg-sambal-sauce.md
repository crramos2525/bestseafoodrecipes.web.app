By Betty Gold and Grace Elkus. No matter how you&#39;re cooking them, scrambled eggs need little more than butter for the pan and a dash of salt and pepper. If you&#39;ve never tried Sambal Telur (Eggs in Spicy Sambal), this South East Asian side dish will blow your taste buds out of the water. Think the satisfying goodness of hard boiled eggs paired with the fiery heat of spicy Indonesian sambal sauce.

There&#39;s nothing better than thinking you. Stuffed Squid, or Lulas Recheadas, is a signature seafood dish in Portuguese cuisine. They are squid, deliciously filled with chourico, garlic, and onions. Stuffed squid is a flavorful Portuguese seafood dish that is simple and easy to make, and always sure to impress. Make sure your baby squid are thoroughly defrosted before starting the recipe - their small bodies can be a little (actually, more than a little) irritating to navigate if not properly defrosted, and it also means you may be more likely to leave innards behind when cleaning them as.
