- "° Make certain your artichokes and spinach are fully drained. In fact, use cheese cloth and fully squeeze drain your spinach. This will take several attempts to fully drain out its copious fluids. If you don&#39;t have any cheese cloth on hand, use thick paper towels to squeeze fluid.

- "In your oven safe bowl with lid - bake at 350° for 35 to 45 minutes. Or, until dip is bubbling. Pull from oven and stir once more."
- "° Authors Notes: You can add many ingredients of your choosing to this dish but one of the most popular is real crab meat.

In my experience anyway. Use one or the other. Or, neither. Your choice!"
- "If interested in the large chips pictured: Cut 6&#34; fresh, thick tortillas into quarters. Fry in hot vegetable oil with a few dashes garlic oil for 1 minute or less - flipping occasionally until browned. Place on paper towels to drain. Immediately sprinkle with dried parsley first so it&#39;ll stick to chips. Then, sea salt, granulated garlic powder and onion powder. That&#39;s it! Enjoy!"
