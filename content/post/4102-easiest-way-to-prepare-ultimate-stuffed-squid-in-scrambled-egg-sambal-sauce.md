By Betty Gold and Grace Elkus. No matter how you&#39;re cooking them, scrambled eggs need little more than butter for the pan and a dash of salt and pepper. If you&#39;ve never tried Sambal Telur (Eggs in Spicy Sambal), this South East Asian side dish will blow your taste buds out of the water. Think the satisfying goodness of hard boiled eggs paired with the fiery heat of spicy Indonesian sambal sauce.
