- "900 g octopus baby medium or large"
- " Juice of one lemon use less if preferred"
- " Olive oil"
- "3 garlic cloves finely diced"
- "to taste Salt"
- "to taste Freshly ground black pepper"
- "1/2 dried oregano I used wild oregano"
- "1 bunch fresh chopped parsley"
recipeinstructions:
- "I always boil the octopus first. I boil it anywhere between 45 minutes to 120 minutes depending on how soft I want the octopus to become. I asked the fishmonger to prepare the octopus for ease so it was literally just adding it to slightly salted water and allowing it to boil."
- "Remove the octopus from the pot, rinse under cold water and allow to cool to room temperature for 30-60 minutes before grilling. While cooling drizzle some olive over the octopus and add the garlic to marinade."
- "This is so much better on the barbecue but as its middle of winter here, I had to settle for a grill pan. So heat it up to medium/high heat, slice the tentacles to cook individually. Grill on each side for 3-5 minutes."
- "Place in a bowl and drizzle the lemon juice, some more olive oil, parsley and oregano. Season with salt and pepper then gently toss the octopus in the sauce and serve."
