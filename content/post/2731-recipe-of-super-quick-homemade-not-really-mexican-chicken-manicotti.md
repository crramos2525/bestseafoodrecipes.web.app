recipeingredient:
- "1 manicotti shells lg pasta shells work too"
- "2 can chunk chicken breast in a can drained really well 2C of rotisserie chicken shredded is awesome"
- "2 cup shredded monterey jack cheese"
- "2 cup shredded sharp cheddar"
- "1 cup sour cream 8oz"
- "1 small onion diced optional and I did not add this time"
- "1 can chopped green chilies 4oz"
- "1 can condensed cream of chicken soup undiluted 1075oz"
- "1 cup salsa"
- "2/3 cup milk"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 350*"
- "Go ahead and cook your manicotti, but only just to al dente (7 mins is what I prefer)"
- "Gather ingredients for the chicken mixture: cheese, sour cream, chilies, onion, and chicken."
- "Drain chicken well and separate with a fork or your fingers."
- "In a large bowl mix 1 1/2 cups monterey jack cheese, 1 1/2 cups cheddar cheese, sour cream, chilies and half the diced onion if you are using it into the chicken."

- "Mix it all up with a fork."
- "Spread 3/4 C of the salsa mixture into the bottom of a 9x13 baking dish"

- "It&#39;s stuffin&#39; time! It is easier to stuff manicotti shells little by little and only halfway up...."
- ".....then flip it around and do it again."
- "As you fill the manicotti, add them to your baking dish until you are packed in. (I can usually fit all but one- don&#39;t squeeze them in or they will be impossible to get out when done)"
- "Top with remaining salsa mixture."
- "Cover with foil and bake at 350* for 30 mins"
- "Remove the foil and now add the rest of your cheeses (1/2 C of cheddar and 1/2 C of monterey jack) and bake for another 10 mins or until cheese is melted (or browned like a real person eats it)"
- "This is the beauty of the entire pan."
