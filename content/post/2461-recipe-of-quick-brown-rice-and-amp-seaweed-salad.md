Hey everyone, it is me again, Dan, welcome to our recipe site. Today, I'm gonna show you how to make a distinctive dish, brown rice &amp; seaweed salad. One of my favorites. This time, I'm gonna make it a bit tasty. This will be really delicious.

Brown Rice is a whole-grain rice with the inedible outer hull removed. White rice is the same grain but has the hull, bran layer, and cereal germ removed. Red rice, gold rice, and black rice (also called purple rice) are all whole rices, but with differently pigmented outer layers.

To get started with this recipe, we have to first prepare a few components. You can have brown rice &amp; seaweed salad using 13 ingredients and 6 steps. Here is how you cook that.

##### The ingredients needed to make Brown Rice &amp; Seaweed Salad:

1. Prepare 1 cup brown/wild rice (I used barley and millet)
1. Take 21/2 cups water
1. Get 1 cup pumpkin seeds
1. Prepare 1 Tbsp soy sauce
1. Prepare 1-2 spring onions
1. Take 3 Tbsp finely sliced pickled sushi ginger or grated fresh ginger
1. Prepare 3 Tbsp mirin or lemon juice
1. Take 1 tsp sesame oil
1. Make ready 2 Tbsp oil
1. Get 1 Tbsp soy sauce,
1. Take  salt and pepper
1. Get  sliced nori (seaweed sheets)
1. Get  Frozen peas (if desired)


The process that produces brown rice removes only the outermost layer, the hull, of the rice kernel and is the least damaging to its nutritional value. The complete milling and polishing that converts. Slow and low is the way to go. Yes, it takes a little longer than white rice, but it&#39;s not any harder.

Is brown rice or white rice better for health? If you&#39;ve ever cooked brown rice that turned out gummy, undercooked, or stuck to the bottom of the pan, join the club.
