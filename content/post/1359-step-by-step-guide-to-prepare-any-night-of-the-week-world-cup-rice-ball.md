Much like sandwiches in the West, onigiri is readily available in convenience stores across Japan, and it&#39;s great. At the World Cup level, these tiny changes in a ball&#39;s aerodynamics can legitimately impact a team&#39;s performance, so the intense scrutiny of the World Cup ball is perhaps to be expected. &#34;You could argue that it&#39;s the most important piece of equipment in the most popular sport in the world. For small rice balls divide the dough. For a giant one keep the ball as one and cover with saran wrap to make sure it doesn&#39;t dry out. Take the ball with one hand and dip with water and the other to coat with sesame seeds.
