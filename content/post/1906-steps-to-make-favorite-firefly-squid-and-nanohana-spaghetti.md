recipeingredient:
- "80 grams Spaghetti"
- "80 grams Firefly squid"
- "2 Nanohana"
- "1 clove Garlic"
- "2 Red chili peppers"
- "2 tbsp Olive oil"
- "2 tbsp White wine"
recipeinstructions:
- "Remove the eyes and cartilage from the firefly squid. It&#39;s easier to use bone tweezers."
- "Cut the nanohana into bite-sized pieces, and separate into the thick part (mostly stems) and soft part (mostly leaves). Cut the garlic into thick slices, and remove the core. Remove the seeds from the red chili peppers."
- "Dissolve 8-10 g of salt in 1 liter of boiling water, and cook the spaghetti 2 minutes less than the time instructed on the package."
- "Add 1 tablespoon of olive oil, garlic, and red chili peppers into a cold frying pan, then heat the pan over low heat. Let the oil absorb the aromas."
- "Remove the red chili peppers from the pan since they get burnt easily. When the garlic changes its colour, add the firefly squid, and briefly stir-fry. Add 2 tablespoons of white wine and evaporate the alcohol."
- "Turn off the heat, and wait for the pasta to finish cooking. Cook the nanohana in the pot with the pasta. Cook the thick part of the nanohana for 30 seconds and the soft part for 10 seconds."
- "Transfer the pasta and nanohana into the pan without draining the excess water, and gently mix for about 1 minute to let the pasta absorb the sauce."
- "When the sauce starts to thicken, swirl in 1 tablespoon of olive oil at the end, and briefly stir."
- "Serve on a plate, and it&#39;s done."
