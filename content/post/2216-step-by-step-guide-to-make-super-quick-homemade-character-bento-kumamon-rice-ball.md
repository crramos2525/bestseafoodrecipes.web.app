recipeinstructions:
- "For the head, make a large slightly elliptical rice ball, followed by 2 small round ones for the ears. Cook the pasta in a frying pan."
- "Cover the rice balls in nori seaweed. To smooth out the straight edges of seaweed that are poking out, insert some cuts in a circle around the edge and wrap them under the rice, overlapping some sections of the nori. Wrap everything in cling film to let the nori seaweed soften into the rice."
- "Cut out one large circle of cheese and 6 smaller circles of cheese of the same size to make the ears, eyes and cheeks. Cut out 2 circles of the same size from the imitation crab to create the cheeks."
- "For the eyebrows, if you use a bit of cheese where there is an edge left behind from cutting out a circle you should get a nice curve. Cut the pupils, nose and mouth out of nori seaweed."
- "Fix Kumamon&#39;s ears in place with the pasta. Arrange the facial features on the face and you&#39;re done. When you fix the kanikama in place for the cheeks you&#39;ll instantly recognise Kumamon."
