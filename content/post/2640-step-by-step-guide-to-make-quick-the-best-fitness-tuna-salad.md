recipeinstructions:
- "First, you need to break up the tuna with a fork. Toss with the mixed salad."
- "Cut your tomato, red onion, olives, cucumber into small pieces and add them to the tuna-salad mix."
- "Here go the chickpeas and then mix all the things together in your bowl."
- "When you are done, you can make your topping and seasoning. For the topping you just squeeze the lemon, to taste, if using.

- "Enjoy!"
