The city I used to live in Korea call Uijeongbu, is known for Budae Jjigae. Budae Jjigae, or army stew, originated shortly after the Korean War when food was scarce and many Koreans were starving. Food was smuggled from American military bases. Today, budae jjigae is a popular Korean dish with lots of seasonal ingredients such as mushrooms, kimchi, tofu and minced beef.
