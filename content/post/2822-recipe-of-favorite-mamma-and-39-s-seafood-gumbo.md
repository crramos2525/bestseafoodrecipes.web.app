First time I ordered from Mama&#39;s I wanted an oyster poboy and crab claws, but oysters and crab claws were not available. This is a great seafood stew &#34;gumbo&#34;. This would be great with mussels and some pieces of cod too. Gumbo is a stew or soup that consists of a flavored stock, meat and/or shellfish, a thickener and vegetables. This seafood gumbo recipe was originally titled Super Bowl Seafood Gumbo, as the author makes this Cajun specialty each year for the occasion, just as his mother did before him.
