- "10 Cherry tomatoes"
- "1 leg Boiled octopus"
- "1 Cucumber"
- "1 Wakame seaweed"
- "150 ml Vinegar"
- "4 tbsp Sugar"
- "1/2 tsp Salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "Make the vinegar base. Bring the ingredients marked ☆ to the boil (cook down the vinegar), and let cool."
- "Cut the cucumber &#34;jabara&#34; style (making deep incisions as if slicing into rounds on both sides of the cucumber at very narrow intervals. It should like the cucumber has been sliced into rounds, but with the slices barely still connected), rub with salt, and set aside. Rehydrate the wakame (salted or cut wakame is fine.) Slice the octopus into bite-sized pieces."
- "Peel the tomatoes by briefly dunking them in a small pan of boiling water. When the peel starts to break, transfer to a bowl of ice water. This makes them easier to peel."
- "Wash the salt off the cucumber, and squeeze firmly. Add the ingredients from Steps 2 and 3 to the vinegar base, and it&#39;s done. If you let it sit for a while, the flavours will blend."
