- "As soon as you see bubbles start to form along the edge, add in the bloomed gelatine.  Stir to combine well and remove from heat.  Ladle the mixture slowly and gradually into the yolk mixture while still whisking to temper the yolks."
- "Keep ladling until the mixture is fully incorporated.  Set aside to cool down slightly.  In a separate bowl, using a hand mixer, whip cream until stiff peaks form.  Fold the whipped cream into the yolk mixture in 1/3 portions.  Fold until well combined."

In a sauce pot over medium low heat, add water, sugar and condensed milk.  Stir to combine well and until the sugar has dissolved."

- "Allow the mixture to boil for about 4 to 6 mins.  Drain off the water thru a strainer.  Return the beans into the sauce pot.  Add in more than enuff water, about 500ml, to fully submerge the beans.  Bring it up to a boil."

- "Add in the remaining 15g of white chocolate.  Stir until completely melted. This is to temper the white chocolate.  To create that curl effect, I use a thicker piece of paper and roll it to create a curve.  Using a paint brush, brush the tempered chocolate onto a parchment paper."
- "Brush to resemble leaves. A total of 12 leaves.  Place the parchment paper over the curled thick paper.  Set aside in the fridge until completely chilled.  Once chilled, brush a thick dot on a parchment paper."
- "Place the 3 leaves onto the dot to resemble a flower pod.  Repeat the process for the remaining leaves.  Set aside in the fridge until completely chilled.  *Pls tuned in my Instagram highlights for better visual.*"
- "Assembly and serve.  Melt the mirror glaze on a double boiler.  Unmold the frozen mousse spheres onto a cooling rack over a sheet pan.  Pour the mirror glaze over the spheres.  Let the glazed sphere sit for while for the mirror glaze to set and scrape off any excess droplets."
