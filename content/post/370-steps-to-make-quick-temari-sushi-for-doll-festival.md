- "Cut the eyes and mouths out with nori and stick on the faces. Use the denbu for the cheeks. If you don&#39;t have denbu, use ketchup instead."
- "If you have the energy to do so, make the fan and scale from the remaining thin omelet. They will stick naturally to the dolls."
- "All done!"
- "The picture shows the old sitting arrangement. Now in the Kanto region, it seems that it&#39;s fashionable to have the girl doll sitting on the right side."
