recipeingredient:
- "1 whole squid Squid"
- "1 rice bowls worth Rice leftover rice is fine"
- "1/4 piece Sliced ginger"
- " The seasonings per 1 squid"
- "2 tbsp Sugar"
- "3 tbsp Soy sauce"
- "3 tbsp Mirin"
- "1 tbsp Cooking sake"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a pan over low heat, add and cook the seasonings, until the sugar dissolves.  (Multiply the seasoning measurement according to how many squid you are making, then plus one. e.g.: If you are cooking 2 squid, 2+1= 3, so use 3 times the seasoning amounts.) Turn off the heat once the sugar dissolves."
- "Make the seasoned rice by adding some liquid (the amount is up to you) to cooked rice (if you are using leftover rice, microwave it)."
- "Clean the squid (refer to Step 4 for an easy way), and pierce some holes in the surface using a toothpick."
- "Insert your hand into the body of the squid, remove the cartridge by disconnecting it from the flesh, grab and pull the cartridge near where the eyes are. The plastic-like cartridge will come out easily."
- "Stuff up to 80% of the squid body with seasoned rice and secure it with a toothpick. (It will burst if you stuff it too much, so watch out!)"
- "I hear from many people that stuffing the rice is the hard part. It is really not a big hint, but it may be easier to handle the rice if you wet the spoon from time to time."
- "In a pot, add the ginger and squid, with a piece of aluminium foil and simmer over low heat for about 20-30 minutes. Flip the squid occasionally."
- "Once the sauce is reduced, and the squid is simmered to nice golden brown color, it is done.  Cool it down, cut into round pieces, serve it on a plate and drizzle the sauce over it."
