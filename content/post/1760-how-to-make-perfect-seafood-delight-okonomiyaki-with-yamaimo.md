Yamaimo is difficult to obtain in Australia and probably in most countries outside of Japan. My okonomiyaki always has an egg in the middle before placing meat/seafood. Some okonomiyaki flour is already mixed with yamaimo powder to make perfect okonomiyaki. Last night, I had grated yamaimo.

Last weekend, I found this mushroom at a Korean supermarket. It read, &#34;Seafood Mushroom&#34; and &#34;シーフードキノコ&#34; in Japane. Yamaimo/Nagaimo/Tororoimo is a type of yam that can be eaten raw and is used frequently in Japanese cooking. This confused me when I was a child because my grandmother always called it Tororoimo but my mom would mix it up and call it Nagaimo and Tororoimo. Okonomiyaki is getting slowly more popular outside of Japan.
