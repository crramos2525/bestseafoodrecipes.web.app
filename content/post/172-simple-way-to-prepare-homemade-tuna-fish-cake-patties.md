recipeinstructions:
- "In a large bowl add in the tuna, mayo, herbs and spices listed under the &#39;patties&#39; section of the ingredient list, (don&#39;t add the potato yet). Season well with salt and pepper. Mix together well."
- "Take the baked potato and using a large sharp knife, cut it up into very small pieces. Add it to the tuna and combine well. Mix in the lemon juice and spring onions. Mash up any larger chunks of potato left using the back of a fork, so it&#39;s a nice even texture."

- "Heat a large frying pan up over a medium heat. Spray in a layer of cooking oil. Once nice and hot, add in the patties and gently fry for a few minutes on each side until the breadcrumbs are golden and the fishcakes heated through to the middle."
