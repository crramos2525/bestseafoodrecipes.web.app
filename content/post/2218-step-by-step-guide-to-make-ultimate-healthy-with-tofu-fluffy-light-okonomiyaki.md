recipeingredient:
- " For the batter"
- "150 grams Okonomiyaki flour or plain flour with some dashi stock granules"
- "1 block Silken tofu"
- "150 grams Nagaimo yam"
- "2 Eggs"
- " Additions to the batter"
- "300 grams Cabbage"
- "80 to 100 grams Chopped green onion"
- "8 slice Thinly sliced pork belly"
- "1 Tempura crumbs dried shrimp"
recipeinstructions:
- "Make the batter: Mix the tofu in a bowl until smooth with a spoon. Add the grated nagaimo yam and egg, and mix well."
- "Add the flour and mix. It should be the consistency where a spoonful drops down with a plop."
- "Cut up the vegetables: cut the cabbage into 1 cm square pieces, and the green onion 3 mm thick. If you chop up the stem part of the cabbage too, it will add a crunchy texture."
- "Heat up a frying pan without any oil. Cook the pork belly slices on one side only and take out. Wipe out the excess oil from the frying pan."
- "Divide the batter into half. Add half the additional ingredients except for the pork belly to the batter, and mix while incorporating air."
- "Heat up the frying pan again over low heat and pour in the combined batter. Lay the pork belly slices on top with the uncooked side facing up."
- "Cook the pancake for 5 to 6 minutes on each side without a lid. When it&#39;s cooked through, raise the heat to medium and continue cooking until the surface is browned to your liking."
- "Cover with okonomiyaki sauce, mayonnaise, bonito flakes, and aonori seaweed, and it&#39;s done! Repeat with the rest of the batter and additions."
