- "1 Octopus shrimp squid"

recipeinstructions:
- "Sift the ☆ ingredients together. (If you don&#39;t have cake flour in your region, use pastry flour.)"
- "Break the eggs into a bowl and beat them."
- "Add dashi stock granules to the eggs. Add water little by little while whisking."
- "Put sifted flour into the egg mixture, and stir until there are no lumps."
- "Cover the bowl of batter with plastic wrap, and let it rest in the refrigerator. In the meantime, get the fillings ready."
- "When everything is ready, switch on the takoyaki maker to heat it up. Don&#39;t forget to plug it in first!"
- "When the takoyaki maker has heated properly, oil it generously. Use plenty of oil to make the outsides crispy!!"
- "Pour in batter to fill about 80 to 90% full. Put a piece of octopus (or other filling) into each hole. The flour tends to sink to the bottom of the batter, so give it a little stir each time you pour it in."
- "Add enough batter to the takoyaki pan to hide the surface completely, and add tenkasu (tempura batter crumbs), green onion, and red ginger."
- "When the outsides of the batter in the indentations come up as shown, it&#39;s time to flip them over!"
- "It looks like this when you flip the balls. It looks like a mess, but don&#39;t worry."
- "Flip the balls repeatedly while tucking the raggedy pieces under them. The balls will become rounder and rounder. Add some oil if needed."
- "When the balls are done, pour on the toppings of your choice and enjoy!"
- "Since I live overseas, it&#39;s difficult for me to get a hold of octopus. So I substitute it with squid or shrimp. I make my own tenkasu, and blend my own sauce."
