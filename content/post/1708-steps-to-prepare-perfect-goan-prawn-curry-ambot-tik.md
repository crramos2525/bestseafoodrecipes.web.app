Cooked traditionally with fish the key to this The heat of the curry comes from the dried chillies. I&#39;ve opted for Kashmiri chillies which lend a lovely Traditional Ambot tik has no coconut in it. It features chillies garlic/ginger and tamarind mainly. The meaning of Ambot is sour and tik is spicy in portugese and here comes another portugese influenced delicious dish from Goa, made with fish that has less bones, the Ambot Tik. In the meantime grind the above masala ingredients with a little water to get the ambot tik masala.
