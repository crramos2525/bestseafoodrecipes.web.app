##### The ingredients needed to make Lower Fat Creamy Alfredo:

This is a huge calorie saver. I use fat free cream cheese, and throw in a dollop of fat free sour cream, but I cut the butter to almost nil. Fresh ground pepper, garlic powder, and sometimes the parmesan. There&#39;s a time and place for the full fat, heavy cream alfredo sauce, because it IS delicious, but spring is literally right around the corner, so something light was a must.

This Healthy Alfredo Sauce is lightened up with skim milk and your choice of broth (chicken or veggie for flava), but is kept creamy with the help of non fat plain greek. I started by placing milk, low fat cream cheese, flour and salt in a blender and blended it until it was completely smooth. A skinny take on Alfredo sauce, this quick and easy recipe has no butter or cream, and is great served on pasta.. Almond Milk rather than Low Fat Milk, and Mozzarella instead of Parmesan. ( I did add an extra Tbs of flour) And it turned out amazing!!!!! Best for Pizza - Classico Light Creamy Alfredo Sauce &#34;Authentic Italian flavors, rich and creamy in texture, low fat, low in calories, made of high-quality ingredients, gluten-free, made with fresh cream.&#34; Best for Fettuccine - Classico Riserva Alfredo Sauce low-fat milk (you can use any milk, even soy) Parmesan cheese (if you freshly grate it, it will be more flavorful) Both the sauce and pasta cook quickly.
