From salmon to chicken to shrimp, fresh dill is a vibrant and fragrant herb that spices up any dish. My love of dill started rather recently when I made dill-infused vodka. I found that, compared to the overpowering taste of dill I ate in Scandinavian recipes growing up, when the herb was infused with vodka it provided a light pickle-y flavor that was a great addition to a classic martini. I found that the same can be said when a small amount of dill is added to things like salads, yogurt. Dillweed is a turn-of-the century home built by the Dill family, early settlers of Dilltown.
