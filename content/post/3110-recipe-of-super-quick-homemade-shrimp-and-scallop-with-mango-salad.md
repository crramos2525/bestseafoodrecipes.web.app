Melissa Clark Sauteed Scallops with Brown Butter, Rosemary and Preserved Lemon. Bring a pot of salted water to boil. A simple mango salad topped with two perfectly seasoned and seared scallops made an ideal appetizer for two tonight. When mangos are in season, I love to add them to salads, like this Strawberry-Mango Arugula Salad. I&#39;m inspired to use them in different dishes, like this Mango Chicken, or Slow Cooker Thai Mango Chicken, or these Thai Chicken Lettuce Wraps.
