recipeinstructions:
- "In a small bowl mix together all dry spices for sauce EXCEPT for paprika and sugar. Set aside."
- "Shrimp: Heat a large, heavy bottomed, deep sided skillet over medium heat. Add olive oil and allow to heat until just shimmering but not smoking. Note: You can use the same amount of ghee (clarified butter) instead of olive oil for a more traditional route, olive oil is just better for you. ;)"
- "Shrimp: Add prepared shrimp to hot skillet. Sprinkle with curry powder, as well as salt and sugar if using. Cook until just barely opaque, stirring constantly to prevent burning. About 1 - 2 minutes. You don&#39;t want them cooked all the way through so they will finish in the sauce without becoming tough/chewy. Transfer shrimp to bowl along with any liquids in skillet and set aside. Note: you will have some curry stick in the skillet. This is good for adding flavor to the sauce. :)"
- "Sauce: Maintain skillet over medium heat. Add olive oil for sauce and again heat to shimmering but not smoking. Add onion and sautee until it begins to soften, stirring frequently. About 2 minutes. Add garlic and sauce spice mix. Sautee until fragrant, stirring constantly so spices and garlic do not burn. About 2 minutes more."
- "Sauce: Add tomato sauce. Stir to combine everything, scraping the bottom of the pan to deglaze and pick up all the yummy bits that have stuck so far. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, until sauce has reduced and thickened, stirring frequently. About 10 - 15 minutes."
- "Sauce: When sauce has thickened add paprika, sugar and coconut milk. Stirring well to incorporate. Taste and adjust seasoning for heat, sweet and salt to your liking. Simmer 10 minutes more, stirring almost constantly. Add shrimp, Stir to coat, turn heat down to medium low (simmering should slow), cover and let cook untouched for 5 minutes more."
- "Finish: Serve over a bed of fresh jasmine rice along side a nice vegetable curry, such as my curry potatoes with peas and carrots. Enjoy!"
- "Note 1: Start with just 1/2 tsp of cayenne in the spice mix if you want less heat. We go for the full tsp because it&#39;s about a nice, medium heat. If you want it REALLY hot, add up to an extra 1/2 tsp cayenne and use hot curry powder on your shrimp."
- "Note 2: Culinary coconut milk is thicker and richer than standard, canned coconut milk; its consistency is even a little thicker than cream. The brand I buy comes in a small carton in the health food section of my local grocery store. If you cannot find culinary coconut milk a can of regular unsweetened coconut milk will do, but you may need to simmer longer to thicken your sauce back up. And no matter what, always shake your coconut mill vigorously before using because it does separate into the solids and liquids in the can/carton."
