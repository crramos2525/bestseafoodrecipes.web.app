##### The ingredients needed to make 🇬🇧🇯🇵Tempura with Maureen’s Dip:

1. Get 5 scallops
1. Take 2 packs Oyster
1. Make ready  Vegetables
1. Make ready 1 cup flour
1. Prepare 2 tablespoon rice flour
1. Take 1/2 teaspoon baking powder

1. Prepare 1 cube ice
1. Get 2 tablespoon mayonnaise•
1. Make ready 1/2 tablespoon lemon juice•

Tempura dipping sauce is quite simple to make. It is just a mixture of dashi stock (please refer to Home Style Japanese Dashi Stock), mirin. As Mark Grinstein-Camacho mentions, if the ingredients are fresh and delicious on their own and the tempura is fried expertly in good oil, all you need is a little sea salt to enjoy Otherwise I concur with the already given answers - plain or flavoured ama-shio (or sea salt) is the way to go with tempura. They are also served over soba (Tempura Soba), udon (Tempura Udon) or served as a donburi dish. (Tendon) The shrimp tempra are sometimes put inside takeout makunouchi obentou instead of fried prawn.
