recipeingredient:
- "1 1/2 cup Real mayonnaise"
- "3 can tuna in oil"
- "6 hard boiled eggs"
- "6 stalks celery chopped fine"
- "1 tsp onion salt"
- "1 tbsp onion powder"
- "2 small or one large box pasta rings"
- "1 box frozen baby or regular size peas"
recipeinstructions:
- "Boil pasta rings; drain and rinse well with cold water until cool to the touch.  You can add peas to the pasta at the very end and boil for about 30 seconds and then drain and rinse with the pasta to save a step."
- "Hard boil eggs until done; drain then run cold water over them till they feel cool (or add ice to cold water in pan)."
- "In large bowl combine mayo, tuna, onion salt/powder and gently stir together.  Taste mixture; it should taste oniony and a little bit too salty.  If not add small amounts of the onion salt until it does.  You will be adding the rings and eggs so don&#39;t worry about it being too salty."
- "Add chopped celery and mix together.  Add half of the rings and gently fold wet mixture and celery into rings.  When they are combined add rest of rings and gently mix in."
- "Cut hard boiled eggs into small pieces and carefully fold into pasta mixture.  Taste and add mayo and/or more seasoning."
- "Refrigerate until cold.  It actually gets tastier the longer it cools.  You can use finely chopped onions but I prefer the seasonings.  My mom used to add thinly sliced radishes and garnish with sliced boiled eggs and paprika sprinkled on top."
