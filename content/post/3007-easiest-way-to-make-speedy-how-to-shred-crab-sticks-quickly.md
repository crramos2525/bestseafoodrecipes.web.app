recipeingredient:
- "1 as many as needed Imitation crab sticks"
- "1 Knife"
recipeinstructions:
- "Take the crab sticks out of the plastic film. Pressing down on the side of the knife blade, slide it over the crab stick in one direction."
- "If you do this on the top, side and bottom of the stick in the same way, it will shred apart easily."
- "After shredding, cut it in half or whatever length you prefer before using in your cooking so it mixes easily with the other ingredients."
- "An easier version: Even if you just press the side of your knife firmly on the crab stick, it will still separate pretty well."
- "Variation, using chicken tenders: Press down hard on the side of a cooked chicken tender so that it&#39;s flattened to half its original thickness. Shred with your hands."
- "Variation using ham: To pull apart a stack of ham slices that you&#39;ve julienned, hold the shreds with the cut sides facing up, and poke with your knife tip. They&#39;ll separate easily."
