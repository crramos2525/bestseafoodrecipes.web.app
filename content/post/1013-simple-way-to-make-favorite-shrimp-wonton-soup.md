Since this is a shrimp wonton soup I like to simmer the broth along with the shrimp shells for a few minutes to get even more shrimp flavour into the soup and throwing in some lemongrass and ginger. Wontons are mostly made up of fresh shrimp. The delicately seasoned filling is then wrapped in Wonton Soup and dumplings have always been an obsessed favorite of mine since I was a young. Use shrimp shells to prepare the wonton soup. The soup at the legendary Mak&#39;s Noodles in Hong Kong includes unusual ingredients such as dried flounder and dried shrimp.
