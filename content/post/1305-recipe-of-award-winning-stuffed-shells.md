- "2 egg whites or 13 cup egg beaters or equivalent"
- "15 ounce skim milk ricotta"
- "8 ounce bag part skim mozzarella"
- "1/2 cup parmesan or romano cheese"
- "1/2 tsp. sugar"
- "1/2 tsp. garlic powder"
- "1/8 tsp. salt x2"
- "1/8 tsp. pepper"
- "1/4 bag spinach 2 oz"
- "2 (28 oz.) can Redpack crushed tomatoes or 2 cans plum tomatoes"
- "1 Tbsp. dried basil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Get the sauce cooking. Melt butter/margarine in medium pot (or slow cooker) on LOW HEAT, mince onions as fine as possible and add to pot with the butter. Let simmer for 2 minutes to blanch onions."
- "Mix dried basil with a 1/4 cup of water and microwave in a cup for 45 seconds. This will make a basil &#34;tea&#34;. Strain and add basil &#34;tea&#34; to the sauce."
- "Add cans of tomatoes, basil &#34;tea&#34;, pepper, sugar and 1/8 tsp. salt to pot and let simmer at least an hour (or two). Add more sugar if you like it sweeter."
- "Boil the shells and let cool being careful not to get them torn up."
- "Mix thourloughly the ricotta, parmesan, eggs, garlic powder, 4 oz. mozzarella and cleaned spinach (remove the stems!). I used about a quarter of a bag of spinach."
- "Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Add several ladles of the tomato sauce to a casserole dish. Stuff the shells with cheese mixture and line the casserole dish with stuffed shells."
- "Pour a few more ladles of the tomato sauce over the shells. Cover the dish with foil, poke a hole in the middle to vent. Be careful not to let the tomato sauce get on the foil as it will dissolve the foil! Bake covered for 40 minutes."
- "Uncover and top cooked shells with the rest of the mozzarella cheese. Cook another 10 minutes."
- "Let cool 5 minutes then serve!"
- "I&#39;ve also made this by adding a half pound of hot sausage (or ground beef or even pepperoni) to the sauce. But, the vegetarian version is remarkable. The only really fattening part is the butter/margarine. I don&#39;t like using olive oil as it has a distinctly different taste than the more pungent flavor of butter/margarine. Feel free to use either parmesan or romano cheese. Pecorino romano is by far the best to use if you can."
