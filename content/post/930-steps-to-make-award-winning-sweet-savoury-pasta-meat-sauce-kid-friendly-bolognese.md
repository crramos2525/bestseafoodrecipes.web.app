Here in Manila we love our spaghetti a bit sweetish and very saucy. üòã So both the kids and kids at heart love it. This was gone after the first two sets of guests arrived! This bolognese sauce uses our Vegan Tofu Chorizo as a base with some added bell peppers, olives, artichokes and sun dried tomatoes. Traditionally, it is a slow cooked, meat-based sauce originating from Bologna in Italy.
