Our grilled Tandoori chicken recipe is juicy and exploding with flavor! Tandoori Chicken is a dish that I have had countless times at I have had versions that are dry, look like red food coloring is the main ingredient, and taste bland for all the effort that seemed to go into it. This delicious chicken fried rice is one of our family&#39;s favourites and this recipe is very similar to that we have tried in Anjappar Restaurant (Singapore) recently. Wash and cut the chicken breast into thin strips. Mix the chicken with ½ teaspoon of salt and pepper.
