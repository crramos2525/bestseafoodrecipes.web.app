Tenzaru soba is a classic Japanese summer dish and popular restaurant menu item. It combines two time-tested favorites: tempura and cold soba noodles. As far as presentation is concerned, the tempura is always served separately from the cold soba noodles on different plates. &#34;Shrimp tempura roll is actually my all time favorite! It can be served on its own as a starter dish or as the main ingredient in Sushi rolls like the Dragon or Caterpillar rolls. When preparing quantities, make sure to make a few more than you need as some tend to &#34;disappear&#34; just right after preparation.&#34; Order at Sushi Tei Singapore near you with foodpanda ✔ Delivery to your home or office ✔ Safe &amp; easy payment options.
