Special thanks to Kenshi for the video tribute. This cajun blackened shrimp recipe is one of the best and my absolute favorite ways to cook shrimp. The spice mixture sticks to the shrimp and gives it a crusty outside that is loaded with flavor. Blackening is a style of cooking that is most often associated with Cajun cuisine.
