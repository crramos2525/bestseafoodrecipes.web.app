recipeingredient:
- "200 g (1/2 pound) sushi grade tuna cut into 12inch cubes"
- "2 tablespoons soy sauce"
- "1 teaspoon sesame oil"
- "2 teaspoons teriyaki sauce"
- "2-3 tablespoons light mayonnaise"
- "1 carrot"

- "1 package shrimp or surimi sticks for the shrimp salad"
- " Chefs Note I usually use these prepackaged shrimp or surimi sticks like this"
recipeinstructions:
- "Rinse the rice thoroughly in a strainer or colander under the tap. Once the water that comes out of the rice is completely clean, you can start boiling the rice. Put in a pan with the 400 milliliters of water and bring to the boil. Then lower the heat and cook the rice for 15 minutes. Turn off the heat and let stand for 10 minutes with the lid on the pan.  (Chef’s Note: Keep in mind that the rice still needs to cool down after cooking. This can easily take an hour.)"
- "In a small bowl combine the light mayonnaise and the teriyaki, thin with a little lime or lemon juice to drizzle."
- "In a medium bowl, gently combine the tuna with soy sauce and sesame oil."
- "Slice the carrot into thin layers and slice up your shrimp sticks into small pieces."
- "Mix the shrimp with a little bit mayonnaise. Your shrimp salad is ready!"
- "Spoon the slightly cooled rice (rather a little warm, then cold) into bowls.  Divide the tuna, carrot slices, corns, edamame beans, and the shrimp salad on this."
- "Top the poke bowl with sesame seeds and possibly chili flakes and serve immediately."
- "Enjoy!"
