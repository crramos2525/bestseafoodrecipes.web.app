- "Peel and cut mango into 1cm by 1cm strips. Also cut into thin slices for topping."

- "In a food processor, pulverize oreos into a powder. Use a bag and fists if you must"
- "When the rice is ready, mix in a few tablespoons a condensed milk until the desired texture is acheived. We don’t want a pudding texture, nor do we want individual grains."

- "Roll up one side while holding onto your fillings to avoid it from slipping. Tuck it around your filling, while pulling out the plastic wrap so it doesn’t get rolled in. Continue rolling, while evenly applying pressure to the roll. Once you get to the other side, give it a full roll to regain the circular shape."
- "Slice (dip knife in water in between), and top with mango slices and a sprinkling of cocoa powder."

Mango sticky rice (khao neow mamuang / ข้าวเหนียวมะม่วง) is an amazing and authentic Thai dessert. It is typical street food in Thailand, especially during summer, when mango is in season. This dessert is also popular in other South East Asia countries, including my hometown, Malaysia. Also labeled glutinous rice, mochi rice, pearl rice, or waxy rice, there&#39;s no perfect substitute for sweet rice. The next best bets are sushi rice and jasmine rice, followed by basmati.
