The seared ahi tuna is seasoned with just salt, pepper, and a touch of taco seasoning (or you could use lemon pepper which is delicious too!), so the flavours are subtle and mix perfectly with the fresh mango salsa in these ahi fish tacos. While typically ahi tuna can be eaten raw (if it&#39;s fresh sushi grade), I do like to sear the tuna with just a little bit of olive oil in a pan, searing.
