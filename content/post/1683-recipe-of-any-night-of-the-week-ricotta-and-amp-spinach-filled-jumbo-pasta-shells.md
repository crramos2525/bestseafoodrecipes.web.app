Ricotta (Italian pronunciation: [riˈkɔtta]) is an Italian dairy product made from sheep (or cow, goat, buffalo) milk whey left over from the production of cheese. Although typically referred to as ricotta cheese, ricotta is not properly a cheese because it is not produced by coagulation of casein. Soft and creamy ricotta can be used in a huge variety of dishes, from gnocchi and gnudi to pancakes and cheesecake.
