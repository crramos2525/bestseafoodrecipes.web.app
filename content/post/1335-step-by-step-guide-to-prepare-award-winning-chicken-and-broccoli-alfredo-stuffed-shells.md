recipeingredient:
- "12 oz. jumbo shells"
- "1 tbsp. olive oil"
- "2 cups chicken cooked and shredded"
- "2 cups broccoli florets cut small"
- "2 cups ricotta cheese"
- "2 large eggs"
- "to taste oregano"

- "to taste garlic powder"
- "3/4 cup parmesan cheese shredded"
- "1 jar (14.5 oz.) Alfredo sauce divided"
- "3/4 cup mozzarella cheese shredded"
- " parsley for garnish"
recipeinstructions:
- "Start a large pot of water and 1 tbsp. of olive oil heating on high heat. Once it reaches a boil, add in the shells. Cook for 1 minute less than the time called for on the box, they will be easier to stuff this way. Once they are done, drain in a colander and immediately rinse them with cold water. This will stop the cooking process, so that they don&#39;t get any softer. Set them aside."
- "While boiling the shells, start a medium pot of water heating on high heat to start to cook the broccoli (you could also steam them). Once water reaches a boil, add in the broccoli and cook until tender (4-6 minutes). Drain broccoli and set aside."
- "In a large mixing bowl, place your ricotta cheese and crack both eggs. Whisk together until just blended. Next, whisk in the seasonings, to taste and the parmesan cheese."
- "Stir in the chicken and broccoli to the ricotta mixture and stir to combine."
- "Preheat oven to 350 F. Spray a 9x13 deep baking pan or casserole dish with non-stick spray or line with foil. Place about 1/2 of the alfredo sauce you are using onto the bottom of the baking dish and spread around. Set aside."
- "Working 1 at a time, stuff each shell with 1-2 tbsp. of the ricotta and chicken mixture. Set each one in the baking pan side-by-side once stuffed, with the opening facing up. Do this until all are stuffed. Top the shells with the remaining alfredo sauce and then sprinkle with the mozzarella cheese."
- "Cover the baking pan with foil and bake 20 minutes. Then remove the foil and bake an additional 10 minutes. Garnish with parsley and serve immediately. Refrigerate any leftovers."
