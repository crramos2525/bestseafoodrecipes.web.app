That&#39;s it for the ingredient list. I like to serve the salmon with fresh lemon to squeeze over the top, alongside a fresh green veggie or a simple salad. Juicy salmon with rosemary, lemon and garlic, takes minutes to prepare which is always perfect for busy weeknights. It is suggested that we eat fatty fish twice a week. Salmon and Tilapia are my two favorite kinds of fish and if I could live off them only, I would.
