This is one of the popular chaat snack recipe from north India. Few months back, when I had made baked samosas, I had also made this samosa chana chaat. Slightly spicy, full of flavour, my easy vegan filo samosas are yummy comfort food, and since they are baked, contain a fraction of the calories of fried ones. I know, I know, samosas are not supposed to be made with filo pastry but I had a half a pack in the &#39;fridge which needed to be used up, and y&#39;know. I had long time wish to try this mini samosa (or samsa as we call it).
