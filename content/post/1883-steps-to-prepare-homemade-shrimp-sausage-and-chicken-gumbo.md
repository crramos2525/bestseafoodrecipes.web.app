By Rian Handler and Justin Sullivan. Gumbo is a true melting pot dish. Originating in Louisiana it combines the cuisines and ingredients of several cultures Subbing in a spicy Italian for a hot Italian sausage, or a chicken sausage for a pork sausage is totally fine. The curve of the shrimp, the spicy rounds of sausage, the red bell pepper, it was mouth watering to behold and I knew I had to make it. It may not be Authentic, but it is full of flavor.
