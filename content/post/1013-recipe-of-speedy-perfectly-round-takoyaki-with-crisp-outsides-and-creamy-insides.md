##### The ingredients needed to make Perfectly Round Takoyaki With Crisp Outsides and Creamy Insides:

1. Make ready 4 tentacles Octopus (sashimi grade)
1. Make ready 400 ml ▲ Cake flour

Don&#39;t worry though.there are no chunks of octopus in this yummy snack. Count on Frito Lay Japan for new and unique products. The problem is that normally, you would require a special takoyaki pan and some pretty impressive ninja skills to make takoyaki. I found a foolproof workaround using ice cube trays.

For vegetables, steam-roasting ensures that the insides are tender, creamy and soft—velvety, even—before the outsides are blackened. To achieve such consistent roasting results, all you need to do is introduce one new element to your typical process—a little bit of water. Pan-fried chickpeas that are crisp on the outside and creamy inside. These are great on their own as a snack, or topped with yogurt as vegetarian a side dish. These easy eggplant meatballs are made with eggplant, mushrooms, and breadcrumbs for the perfect vegetarian Italian dinner.
