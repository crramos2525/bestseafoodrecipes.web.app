- "Add rice (2 cups seems about right)"
- "Stir until rice is mixed in and heated through. I like to turn the heat down to medium at this point, takes a couple extra minutes, but seems to limit scorching of bits here and there."
- "Add your shrimp, pepper and garlic back in"
- "Stir for about 3 minutes, until it is mixed well, and all is heated through. I also put another grind of black pepper in."
