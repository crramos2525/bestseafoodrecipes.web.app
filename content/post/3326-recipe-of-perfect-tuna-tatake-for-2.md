- "1 pound tuna"
recipeinstructions:
- "Coat tuna well with 1 tablespoon of sesame oil. Let it rest while making the dressing."
- "Boil sake (or substitute) and Mirin for about 10 seconds for the evaporation of the alcohol. Put soy sauce and reduce over low heat to thicken it a little bit (the dressing would stay on the tuna better. Do not leave it unattended). Turn off heat and add lemon zest."
- "Sear the tuna on a hot pan. The goal is to sear just 2mm on each side of the tuna. Do not sear the ends."
- "Slice tuna into 1/4 inch pieces. Arrange tuna in circular on a plate."

- "Drizzle the dressing on tuna."
- "Put some of the crisp onion and radish sprouts in the center of the tuna for garnish."
- "Voila! You have a simple, elegant and yummy dish! Hope you all will enjoy it as much as my husband and I do:)"
