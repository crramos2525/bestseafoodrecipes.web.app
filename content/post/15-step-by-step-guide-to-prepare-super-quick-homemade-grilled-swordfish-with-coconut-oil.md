I first had coconut curry sauce with grouper in a restaurant in South Beach, and fell in love. Whisk the oil, mint, lemon juice, basil, and garlic in a medium bowl to blend. This coconut-crusted swordfish is served with a delightfully tart sauce made with kumquats--tiny citrus fruit that you can eat whole, including the skins and seeds. For an extra hint of coconut flavor, sear the fish steak in coconut oil.
