Spoon the marinated tuna into the cucumber &#34;cups&#34;. This Tuna salad with Avocado and Cucumbers is a modern twist on an American classic. Put the avocado tuna salad between two pieces of toast and you have a rather perfect tuna salad sandwich with the lovely addition of avocado and without any mayonnaise.
