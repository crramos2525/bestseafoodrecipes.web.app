recipeinstructions:
- "Prep the tuna. Sprinkle rock salt and leave for an hour. Be generous with the salt."
- "Rinse off the salt lightly, and pat dry with paper towels."
- "Put a little olive oil in the pan first, then put in the tuna. Add enough oil to cover the tuna, then put in the ★ ingredients."
- "Simmer over very low heat for an hour while skimming off the scum. The tuna will be cooked through in 30 minutes, but it will become tender in another 30 minutes."
- "The oil will change color slightly. After an hour, turn off the heat and leave at room temperature overnight."

- "The oil as well as the tuna are delicious. Use the oil for stir-fry."
- "The oil will harden in the refrigerator, but will become liquid again at room temperature. The oil is used for stir-fry and other recipes, and is not wasted at all. It&#39;s great spread on bread, too."
