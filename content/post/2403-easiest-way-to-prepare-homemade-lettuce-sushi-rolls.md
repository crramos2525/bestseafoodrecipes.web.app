- "900 grams Vinegar rice sushi rice"
- "4 sheets Toasted nori seaweed"
- "4 to 5 leaves Lettuce"
- "4 stick Imitation crab sticks"
- "1 Mayonnaise"
- "1 use 2 medium sized eggs and sugar to taste Japanese tamagoyaki omelette"
recipeinstructions:
- "Prepare the sushi rice with your preferred seasoning. This time, I used a shortcut and made mine with powdered sushi vinegar."
- "Cook a mildly sweet tamagoyaki omelette, adjusting the amount of sugar to your liking. Once it has cooled down, cut the omelette into long, thin strips."
- "Take the crab sticks out of their packaging and shred the lettuce into easy to handle sizes. Rinse both with water and dry off any excess moisture with a paper towel. Once you&#39;ve rearranged the ingredients to roll, you&#39;re all set."
- "Let a sheet of nori seaweed rest on a sushi mat, evenly spread about 220 g of sushi rice on top. 220 g is a guideline, but beware of using too much rice. If you leave around 1 cm of open space on the far side of the nori, it&#39;ll make the rolling easier."
- "In order, lay out the lettuce, followed by the crab sticks, omelette, and finally the mayonnaise."
- "Add another layer of lettuce on top. Then, as with any other sushi roll, start working it into a roll from the bottom."
- "Keep the shape of the rolls by letting them sit with their tails of nori on the bottom."
- "Cut the rolls into your preferred size, plate, and serve!"
