- "1 small 12 piece pack Boiled octopus"
- "1 tbsp Katakuriko"
- "1 Aonori"
- "1 to 2 tablespoons Grated cheese"
- "1 tsp Grated garlic"
- "1 tbsp each Butter and vegetable oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Cut the boiled octopus into bite sized pieces, and pat dry with paper towels. If you don&#39;t dry the pieces well, the coating will slide off"
- "In a plastic bag, add octopus and the katakuriko and shake to coat."
- "Add oil, butter and garlic in a pan over medium heat, and add the octopus. Try not to touch the octopus as it fries, or the coating will come off."
- "When the coating on one side has crisped and browned, turn the pieces over. When both sides are browned, add the grated cheese."
- "When the cheese has melted and become crispy, add aonori seaweed powder for fragrance, and it&#39;s done ♡"
- "Note 1: The boiled octopus and the grated cheese are salty, so I don&#39;t add salt. Taste, and adjust with more cheese or a little salt."
- "Note 2: Both octopus and squid spit when heated! It&#39;s not fun at all to burn yourself. Just cover with a lid if this becomes a problem."
