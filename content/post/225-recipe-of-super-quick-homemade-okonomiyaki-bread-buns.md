recipeingredient:
- "250 grams Bread strong flour"
- "20 grams Sugar"
- "5 grams Salt"
- "4 grams Dry yeast or fresh yeast"
- "1 Egg small"
- "115 grams Water"
- "25 grams Butter"
- " The filling and toppings"
- "2 tsp granules  400 ml water Dashi stock granules and water"
- "100 ml Okonomiyaki sauce"
- "5 tbsp Plain white flour"
- "2 tbsp Cornstarch"
- "1 Red pickled ginger aonori"
- "1 handful Bonito flakes"
- "3 leaves Cabbage"
- "1 Mayonnaise"
- "1 If you are using natural bread starter leaven use this dough"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put all the ☆ ingredients in a bowl. Dissolve the dry or fresh yeast in water and mix in the egg. Add this liquid to the bowl, and mix until the liquid is absorbed. Take the dough out onto a work surface, and knead for about 15 minutes. Seefor kneading instructions."
- "After kneading the dough for 15 minutes, check it to see if a gluten film has formed (if you stretch the dough out thinly, it should form a translucent film). Add the butter and knead for another 10 minutes or so. Lightly grease a large bowl with butter, round off the dough, put it in the bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Leave to rise to 3 times its original volume."
- "Combine the ★ ingredients in a bowl. Finely chop the cabbage, heat up a frying pan with some oil, and stir fry the cabbage. Add the ★ ingredients to the pan. When the sauce has thickened, leave it to cool."
- "When the dough has finished its 1st rise, divide into 10 pieces (each one should weigh about 45 g), round off each piece, cover with plastic wrap and rest for 15 minutes."
- "Flatten each dough ball with your palm, and roll it out with a rolling pin. Put the flattened disc of dough on your hand and put on some filling. If you try to add too much filling you won&#39;t be able to close the dough around it, so be careful."
- "Stretch the dough on 4 sides and wrap it around the filling. Pulling on the dough is the best way to make this work well. Seal the seams very tightly. Do this while holding the dough in your hands."
- "Place the formed buns on a tray lined with kitchen parchment paper. Cover loosely with plastic wrap, and leave to rise for 40 to 50 minutes until doubled in size. Preheat the oven to 190°C."
- "When the buns have doubled in size, snip the tops with kitchen scissors in a crisscross pattern as shown. Open up the cut part a little."
- "Squeeze on a little mayonnaise in the center, and bake for 15 to 20 minutes. Sprinkle on aonori to finish."
- "It&#39;ll be soft and tender inside."
- "If you deep fry the buns in 170°C (low-temperature) oil, they will come out crispy, fragrant and delicious!!! Be careful not to burn yourself."
