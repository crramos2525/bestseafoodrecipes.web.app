- "2 squids Squid tentacles"
- "1 squid Squid innards"
- "1/2 tsp Sake"
- "1/4 tsp Soy sauce"
recipeinstructions:
- "Prepare the squid! Remove the innards and set aside."
- "Preparation: Please cut away the tips of the longest tentacles of the squid. Squid use these tentacles as hands so they&#39;re thought of as dirty....."
- "Chop between the eye and the legs to separate the head and legs."
- "There should be a beak in the center of the tentacles, if you push it out from the leg-side then it should pop out nicely. The photo shows the beak being pushed out with my index finger."
- "Cut the legs into an appropriate size and length. The legs are arranged in a cylindrical shape so if you cut the legs off 2 at a time from the base they should be around the right size."
- "Place the legs on a sheet of aluminum foil and wring out the innards. Season with some cooking sake and soy sauce (or salt). It&#39;s a bit annoying for me to dress the squid at this point so I leave it until after it&#39;s cooked. If you would prefer to dress the squid at this point, though, feel free to do so."
- "Cut the foil down to a size where you can just fit in all of the squid parts then wrap snugly! Cook for 5 minutes in a toaster oven."
- "It&#39;s finished! Eat it while it&#39;s hot! If the flavour is a bit weak then add some soy sauce to your taste."
