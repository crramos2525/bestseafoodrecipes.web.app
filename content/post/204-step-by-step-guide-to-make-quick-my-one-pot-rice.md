This one pot ratatouille rice takes my corruption of French cuisine a step further by cooking the rice in the same pot too.

I found it cooks best in an in-between time. Make a circle in the center of the rice and add your saut√©ed vegetables and black beans to the skillet and mix. The Instant Pot is for the main dish. I tried both soaking rice and skip soaking rice prior to cook rice in the Instant Pot. Whether it&#39;s cooked in manual mode or &#34;Rice&#34; mode, when I didn&#39;t soak rice, it did not become tender all the way through.
