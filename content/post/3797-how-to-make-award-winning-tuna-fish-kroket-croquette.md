Croquettes are a classic fried dish that can contain potatoes, meat, or seafood. This version is similar to a crab cake, but is made with canned tuna and fried in the recognizable croquette shape. You can swap the tuna for canned salmon if desired, just don&#39;t forget to remove any bones and drain the fish first. Panko bread crumbs are added for the absolute best crunch! In a medium bowl, mix together tuna, ¼ cup mushroom soup, ½ cup bread crumbs, onion and egg.
