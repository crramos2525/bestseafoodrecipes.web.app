Given squid&#39;s mild flavor, the tomato sauce really dictates which wine to serve with this dish. Cook the squid over medium high heat, stirring often, until the pieces go from translucent to opaque, and look white. Then add the tomatoes, garlic, oregano and white wine. Bright red tomatos are peeled and chopped and cooked very briefly with tomato paste and sauteed garlic to make a fresh and colorful sauce for hot pasta.

Stir in fresh basil just before combining the sauce with the pasta, then top with Parmesan cheese. I have always been emphatically anti-tomato when it comes to seafood sauces, liking my spaghetti alle vongole and any similarly conceived dish strictly in bianco. I don&#39;t renounce my previous preferences, but find I am now an enthusiastic consumer of the more southerly and less elegant red sauces, too. I certainly love the gutsiness of this fiery, tomatoey squid pasta. Meanwhile, add the octopus and the oil and garlic (from the medium skillet) to the tomato sauce.
