- "1 Fresh lobster tails"
- "1 salt"
- "1 lemon"
- "1 tbsp of butter"
recipeinstructions:
- "Boil 4 to 6 cups of water"
- "Add lobster tails to boiling water and reduce heat to simmer"
- "Cook time: Simmer 1 minute per 1oz. So if your lobster tail is 5oz, leave in for 5 minutes. (This does not increase by quantity, if you are boiling 4 lobster tails, all at 5oz each, time in water will remain 5 minutes)."
- "As the lobster tails simmer, slice your lemon into 4 slices, and melt your butter in the microwave for 1 minute."
- "Pull your lobster tails from water and use kitchen shears to cut them long ways. You just want to cut the shell, you can use a knife to cut the lobster evenly and spread apart for your butterfly effect. Do not cut all the way to the bottom shell, just a nice gentle slice ontop to spread apart the lobster will work nicely."
