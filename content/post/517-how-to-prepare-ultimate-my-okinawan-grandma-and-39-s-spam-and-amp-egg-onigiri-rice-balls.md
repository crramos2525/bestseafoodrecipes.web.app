recipeingredient:
- "700 grams or 4 servings plain cooked rice"
- "1/2 can Spam"
- "2 Eggs beaten"
- "2 sheets nori seaweed"
- " Mayonnaise optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "First, prepare the fillings. Cut the Spam into 4 slices. In Okinawa, there are may different brands of canned &#34;pork&#34; that are available like Tulip."
- "Fry the slices of Spam on both sides using a generous amount of oil."
- "After cooking the spam, cook thin &#34;omelettes&#34; (or more like crepes) using the remaining oil in the pan.  The salt from the Spam will season the egg so you won&#39;t need to add any salt."
- "I am using the &#34;Homel Spam Musubi Maker&#34; for this recipe. Place the musubi maker on top of the seaweed and add a thin layer of rice."
- "It&#39;s a little difficult to shape the rice without the musubi maker, but you can still make it in a rice ball style: simply spread out rice across the center of the nori sheet, leaving plenty of space on each side to fold over at the end."
- "Next, place a layer of Spam and mayonnaise on top of the rice (without mayonnaise is ok too)."
- "Lay the cooked egg on top."
- "Add another layer of rice on top of everything and press down."
- "Remove the musubi maker mold, if using, then wrap the edges of the nori seaweed around the layers of rice and spam."
- "Mixing in some fresh ground pepper in the rice gives it a nice extra taste!"
