recipeinstructions:

- "Once the water starts to boil, lower the heat, stir the rice, cover the pot with lid and cook the rice for 20 minutes on low heat. Do not open the lid in between. After 20 minutes, the water will be absorbed and rice is cooked. Fluff the rice with a fork."
- "Remove the rice in a wide dish. Add 3 tbsp of sushi seasoning to it and mix well. (I have used store brought obento brand Sushi seasoning. It is a mix of rice vinegar, salt and sugar). The vinegared rice is ready. Keep aside the rice to cool. (The rice should be cooled before making sushi)."

- "Now put a fistful of rice on the cut nori sheet. Spread it evenly on the sheet. Leave around 2 cm space on the top of the nori sheet as shown. Place the choice of your topping on it as shown. I have used Avocado strips. (You can use lengthwise cut cucumber, tofu, carrot)."
- "Now lift the end of the mat closest to you and begin to roll the sheet tightly. It should come at the end of the other end of the nori sheet leaving the 2 cm gap as shown. Press the roll tightly so that the edge of the nori sheet is tight."
- "Open the mat roll the remaining roll. And roll and join the other end of the nori sheet. (You can also brush the other end of the nori sheet with water to help it sticking better to the roll).Now again with the help of the mat press the roll tightly so that it is nicely stuck and becomes a tight roll."
- "Now cut the uneven end of the roll and cut into half with a sharp knife dipped in the water sushi seasoning solution. This helps to prevent knife sticking to the the sushi while cutting into pieces."
- "Cut each halves into 3-4 small pieces."
- "Arrange the cut sushi pieces into a plate and serve with the dipping sauce."
