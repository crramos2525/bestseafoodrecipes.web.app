In Chinese tradition, eight is a lucky number. It&#39;s represented here by the delicious &#34;treasures&#34; that comprise the dish: eggs, shrimp, shiitake mushrooms, edamame, sausage or ham, pineapple, cashews and cilantro. Cooking and chilling the rice the day before makes it easy to crumble into separate grains, which is essential for fluffy, flavorful fried rice.
