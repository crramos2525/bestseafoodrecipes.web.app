- "1 frozen precooked lobster in its shell or equivalent ready prepared lobster"
- "2 small onion peeled and finely chopped"
- "1 garlic clove"
- " white wine"
- "160 g spaghetti"
- "3 heaped spoonfuls crme frache"
- "1 handful fresh dill snipped"

- " Rocket salad to serve dressed with lemon juice olive oil salt pepper and grated Parmesan"
recipeinstructions:
- "This is how the lobster looks when its defrosted. Twist off the claws, and use your fingers and a pair of scissors to gently crack the shell and remove the meat from the tail and claws. The back legs on mine were too small for any meat to be inside but you can use a wooden skewer to prise any little bits out of nooks and crannies."
- "Set aside all the pieces of white meat in a bowl, cover and put in the fridge. I put all the roe and innards in a pan with the shells for stock, but some people like to eat those bits too."
- "Put all the pieces of shell in a large pan, and just cover with cold water. Bring to the boil and cover, then boil for around 30 minutes. Drain, throw away the shell, clean the pan, then return to stock to the pan and reduce right down until you have about 100ml left."
- "When you are ready to cook the pasta add the stock to a small pan with the finely chopped onion and garlic, simmer until the onion is soft. Add a dash of white wine and season to taste with salt (if needed) and black pepper."
- "Cook the pasta in salted water until tender, drain quickly (so it retains a little of the cooking water) return to the pan, and add the stock, heat gently, stirring until the stock is absorbed, then add the crème fraîche, snipped dill and Parmesan and stir through with plenty of black pepper."
- "Dress the rocket salad and stir in a handful of Parmesan cheese."
- "Finally, cut the lobster flesh into bite-sized pieces and fold into the pasta, heating gently. Serve hot, with the salad, in front of the Christmas tree!"
