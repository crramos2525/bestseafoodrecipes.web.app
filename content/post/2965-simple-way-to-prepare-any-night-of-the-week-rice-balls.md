Roll into remaining bread crumbs until well coated. They&#39;re fun to make and are a staple of Japanese lunchboxes (bento). You can put almost anything in an onigiri; try substituting grilled salmon, pickled plums, beef, pork, turkey, or tuna with mayonnaise. Remove from oil and drain on paper towels. Serve hot plain, or with your favorite tomato sauce.
