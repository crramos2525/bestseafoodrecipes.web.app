No Bake Cheesecake is a creamy, decadent dessert that comes together quickly, and is super easy! BLUEBERRY PIE FILLING - this is not the same as canned blueberries. It is a specific product that is thickened already and will hold shape when glopped (yes that&#39;s a word) onto the cheesecake. You want a foamy mixture as before. Continue to mix on medium-high, and add cream cheese, vanilla protein powder, vanilla extract, and sour cream.
