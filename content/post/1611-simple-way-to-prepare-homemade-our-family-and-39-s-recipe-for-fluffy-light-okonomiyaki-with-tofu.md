- "100 grams Tenkasu tempura batter crumbs"
- "1 Red pickled ginger"
- "50 grams Green onions chopped"
- "1 Okonomiyaki sauce"

recipeinstructions:
- "Put tofu into a bowl and mash with a whisk. Add the okonomiyaki flour, water, and egg, and mix well. Rest for a while in the refrigerator."
- "Chop up the cabbage roughly. Squeeze out well to remove excess moisture. Chop up the green onions also."
- "Preheat an electric griddle to 390F/200C."
- "Put 1 serving (about 80g) of the batter into a small bowl with about 120 g of chopped cabbage, a little tenkasu, green onion, and red pickled ginger. It will taste better if you have more cabbage than batter."
- "Mix with a spoon to incorporate air into the batter. Do this one pancake serving at a time."
- "The key to a soft, airy fluffy okonomiyaki is to mix up the batter and vegetable while incorporating air just before cooking."

- "After 3 minutes, spread 3 slices of pork on top. When the edges of the pan cake start to dry out, flip the pancake over."
- "Don&#39;t press down on the pancake after flipping. If you do so, the pancake will become flat and lose its light airiness. Only use the spatula to neaten the edges."
- "After about 4 minutes, flip the pancake over again and cook for another 3 minutes or so."
- "Put on okonomiyaki sauce, ao-nori seaweed powder, and bonito flakes, and it&#39;s done."
