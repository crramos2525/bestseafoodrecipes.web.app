recipeingredient:
- "500 to 600 grams Beef tendon"
- "1/2 Daikon radish"
- "4 Eggs"
- "1 Konnyaku"
- "1 as much to taste Chikuwa and other oden ingredients"
- "10 to 12 Bamboo skewers for the been tendondont forget these"
- " For the oden soup storebought is fine"
- "1000 ml Water or bonito dashi stock"
- "1 10cm long piece Kombu"
- "80 ml Sake"
- "80 ml Soy sauce"
- "1 tbsp Sugar"
- "1 1/2 tbsp Bonito dashi stock granules if using water rather than dashi"
- "1/2 to 1 teaspoon Salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "Slice the daikon into the thickness you like, and parboil it. Boil the konnyaku also. Hard boil the eggs and peel."
- "Cut the beef tendon into bite sized pieces using a knife or kitchen shears. Using the shears is easier."
- "Bring plenty of water to a boil in a frying pan, and throw in the beef tendon. Bring to a boil over high heat."
- "A lot of scum will rise to the surface, but just ignore it and simmer over medium heat for 7 to 8 minutes. If the scum bothers you, remove it."
- "Bring the frying pan over to the sink, throw out the hot liquid, pour some lukewarm water over the meat and drain. Don&#39;t burn yourself."
- "When the water in the frying pan is lukewarm, wash the beef tendon by massaging it. Change the water twice, and keep washing the meat until the water runs clear."
- "When it&#39;s washed, spread the meat out on paper towels and pat dry. The beef tendon becomes shiny and clean as shown in the photo."
- "Skewer the beef tendon. And here you have meaty, hearty beef tendon pieces!"
- "I was able to make 10 beef tendon skewers. You can freeze them like this. If you prep a lot of beef tendon in one go it&#39;s very convenient. You can take the skewers out and use the meat in curry and so on."
- "Put the water and seasoning ingredients (bonito dashi stock granules, or storebought oden soup base) in a pan, add the konbu seaweed and simmer to make the dashi or soup base. You can use the konbu seaweed in the oden (re-added later and simmered until tender)."
- "When the soup is boiling, add the beef tendon, and simmer over low heat for 1 hour. Don&#39;t let it boil too hard, or the dashi will become cloudy and not as tasty."
- "Add the parboiled daikon radish, konnyaku, and eggs from step 1, and simmer for another hour or so."
- "As you continue simmering, clear fat from the beef tendon will rise to the surface, so skim it off diligently. This makes the soup stock really delicious."
- "After 2 hours of simmering, the beef tendon will become tender enough that a skewer goes through it easily. The soup stock will be deliciously flavored with the beef tendon too."
- "I always let it rest overnight so that the daikon radish, eggs and meat become permeated with flavor. The next day the fat will have floated to the surface and hardened, so just scoop this out."
- "Heat it up the next day, add more dashi stock and fish paste cakes (such as chikuwa and gobo-maki) of your choice, simmer some more and it&#39;s done!"
- "The meaty beef tendon and the daikon radish which have soaked up the beef soup overnight are just sublime! Mustard and yuzu pepper go well with this."
- "It&#39;s still delicious if you don&#39;t rest it overnight, but in that case make sure to remove any fat from the surface in step 13. The soup will become clean and delicious."
- "Gobo-maki (fish paste sticks with burdock root) and chikuwa fish sticks go very well in this oden. Mochi-kinchaku (mochi rice cake in a fried tofu bag) is delicious too, as it soaks up the beef soup. My favorite is chikuwa."

Sometimes though, they have actual oden packs filled with fish cakes and instant oden soup base. Greens - definitely not traditional and not meant to be simmered in the stock, but I like greens when eating so we just give whatever we have on hand a quick dip in the oden stock then eat it immediately.
