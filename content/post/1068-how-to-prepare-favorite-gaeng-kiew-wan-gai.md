This authentic Thai Green Curry Recipe is a curry made with coconut milk that comes from the Central Thai region. It is most commonly found made with chicken as the protein but you can swap out the chicken for pork, shrimp, seafood, or beef. Green curry is a classic Thai curry (แกงเขียวหวานไก่ - gaeng kiew wan gai) that gets its name from the creamy green color of the sauce. The color predominantly comes from the use of green chilies in the curry paste, but green herbs such as kaffir limes, and Thai basil can also contribute to the verdant color.
