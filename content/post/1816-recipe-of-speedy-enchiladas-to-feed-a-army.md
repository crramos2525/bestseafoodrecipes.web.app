Feeding Frenzy and Death Mark don&#39;t work fully either (former applies Aggressive, but not the damage buff, latter applies only the non-marked damage and the focusing is awkward). No Melee Splash, which is one of the biggest issues besides the spectres only doing good damage if you&#39;re an aurabot. Mr Fox&#39;s house was destroyed and so he and his family had no place to live Feels like it&#39;s been forever. Also, why the actual hell have I still not read the Splatoon manga? Google says his name is Army, he&#39;s a Zap main, and an obsessive note taker.
