There is not a thing wrong with shortcut spaghetti sauce - I use a semi-homemade version of one myself most of the time. It&#39;s a quicker version that takes canned pasta sauce and jazzes it up a bit to give it homemade. Although any purchased spaghetti will do, this dish becomes special enough for company if you use artisanal pasta, preferably imported from Italy. This makes a wonderful first course. (In every Italian household, there is always a pasta course!) Note: To peel tomatoes, core and cut a small X through. Bashing tomatoes, chilli, sugar and shallots together in a pestle and mortar helps to bring out the flavours for a delicious no-cook pasta sauce.
