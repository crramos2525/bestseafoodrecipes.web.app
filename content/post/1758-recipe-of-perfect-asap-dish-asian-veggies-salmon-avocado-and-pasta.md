Drizzle over the dressing and top with a Couscous-crusted salmon with pea and potato salad. To make this Salmon, Avocado and Potato Salad recipe even easier, you could buy ready poached salmon fillets, but I find poaching my own tastes better and is hardly any effort. You could make this veggie by swapping the salmon for feta cheese, a tin of your favourite beans, Quorn pieces or tofu. Avocado pasta is quick, easy, and dairy-free. These smoked salmon, avocado and cucumber bites are the perfect appetizer recipe.
