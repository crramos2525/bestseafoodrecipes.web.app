Salmon and pasta are a dream combination. Add the cream and bring to boil. Stir in the spinach, cheese and herbs. Return the pasta to the pot and toss to coat with the sauce. You need a deep fry pan to cook pasta because the pasta is tossed with the sauce to emulsify (magic that happens with starch in pasta is cooked a bit with the oil in the sauce) which makes the pasta extra glossy, thick and rich.
