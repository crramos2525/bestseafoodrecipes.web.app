I don&#39;t roast the spices for this Sri Lankan crab curry. The reason is that, seafood is more delicate in flavor and roasting the spices makes their flavor profile more robust which can easily overpower the flavor of seafood. The South Indian style Crab Curry is a very spicy and tasty dish prepared often at our home and served as a main course. Crab curry is one of the tastiest dishes in Sri Lanka.
