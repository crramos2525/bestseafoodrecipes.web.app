recipeingredient:
- " for the batter"
- "55 g x plain flour"
- "1 x medium egg"
- "140 ml x milk"
- "5 g x melted butter"
- "100 g x smoked salmon"
- "100 g x creme fraich or cream cheese"
- "1 x small jar of fish roe or caviar opt"
- "1/2 packet dill"
recipeinstructions:
- "Beat the egg, then whisk in the flour, when that is smooth add the milk. It is easier to add 1/3 of the milk and whisk smooth then add the rest."
- "Decant batter into a jug, then remember that you forgot to add the melted butter. So melt the butter in a crepe or non stick frying pan and add it to the batter. Put the batter in the fridge for 30 minutes or more to thicken slightly."
- "Add a tiny amount of oil to the pan and wipe with kitchen paper, Start making pancakes / crepes. These need to be thin but not so thin that they cannot hold the smoked salmon filling. It&#39;s trial and error, the good news is any that don&#39;t work out are just lovely with some syrup."
- "When your on a roll with your pancakes it should be easy, flip them with a pallet knife or toss them if you like. when both sides are golden stack them on a plate. When all done and cooled down you can cover and store in the fridge if your making them in advance."
- "Slice the dill with a sharp knife, and beat it into the creme fraiche, if you want your pancakes to be easier to roll and handle you may prefer cream cheese which is firmer?"
- "Decide which side of the pancake you want to be the presentation side and sit that face down, then spread a couple of tsp of the dill cream mixture over it but not quite to the edges."
- "Tear smoked salmon into small pieces and arrange them over the pancake, then if using fish roe (the jar I bought was about £5) spoon a small row towards the lower end closest to you."
- "Lift up the edge closest to you and encase it over the caviar, then keep rolling it up like a cigar. Sit the pancake on some cling film and roll up."
- "Twist the cling film at the ends to tighten it up and for extra security you can double wrap. Now store in the fridge until just a few minutes before you serve these canapés They will be fine for up to 24 hours before the pancakes start to get soggy."
- "Unwrap the pancake then just trim of the ends with the sharpest knife you have, I cut mine into six pieces, so I started by slicing into 3 even sized peieces."
- "Slice each 3rd on a diagonal but take care to leave at least 1/2 cm gap at the edge so that the pancake doesn&#39;t unravel. I arranged mine on a slate and topped with dill sprigs. Again the creme fraiche makes these very soft so when cutting use a really sharp knife and don&#39;t be heavy handed, cream cheese will be firmer and easier to cut."
- "I served mine with a couple of other lovely canapés check out the video if you like. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3U2V-KFHk0&amp;t=5s"

Finely chop eggs mix with creme fraiche and season with salt and pepper and chives. Serve warm, with the dill cream, smoked salmon and caviar.
