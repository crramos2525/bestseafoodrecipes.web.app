Home made Gochujang (Korean Chili Paste) is simply the best and making it is easier than you might think. In addition, I have also discovered that not all gochujang sold at stores are the same. Did you know that often a not-so-good gochujang has corn syrup, starch. Added more gochujang and a splash of fish sauce, more scallions, too. A twist on a traditional Mediterranean seafood stew that wowed our guests.
