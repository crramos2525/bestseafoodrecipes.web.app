Instead of tuna, you can literally replace it with anything you fancy too. Cook it with some savoury chicken fillings and it will make a chicken pie while curry chicken potatoes. These puff pastry tuna empanadas are quick to make, baked in the oven - healthier than the fried ones. Because I am using puff pastry to make these tuna empanadas I won&#39;t be frying them. This way you will get a healthier Spanish appetizer that still has lots of flavor but it&#39;s better for you.
