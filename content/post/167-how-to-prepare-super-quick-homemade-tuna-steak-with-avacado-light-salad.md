At the time, I had no idea The avocado also helps to add some great richness to an otherwise very light dish. Tuna Stuffed Avocado has cilantro and lime for great flavor, and this is a dinner when it&#39;s too hot to cook or you just I love the idea of the avocado stuffed with the salad….how light, summery and a nice change for ones palate. But it turns out youre not supposed to cook the tuna all the way through. I eat tuna raw all the time in poke bowls. As far as cooked tuna steaks go, the way you cooked it has the best flavor and texture imo.
