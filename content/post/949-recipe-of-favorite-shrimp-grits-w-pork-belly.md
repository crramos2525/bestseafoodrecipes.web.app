Shrimp and Grits is a classic Southern dish that&#39;s quick and easy enough for a busy weeknight meal. I was shocked when I first discovered how ridiculously easy it is to make shrimp and grits, because it&#39;s such a typical restaurant dish that I think of as really flavorful and full of pizzazz. This recipe for shrimp and grits starts with a clever tip for jump-starting the grits that I learned from Southern chef Sean Brock. In an ideal world, we&#39;d all be getting fresh coastal shrimp for our shrimp and grits â€” but we&#39;ll settle for frozen shrimp with the shell on.
