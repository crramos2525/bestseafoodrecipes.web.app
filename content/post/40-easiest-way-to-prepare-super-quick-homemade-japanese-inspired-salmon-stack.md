We had no baking tray at home in those days, as baking wasn&#39;t so common. Wild salmon is marinated and baked in an Asian-inspired soy and sesame sauce, served with hot cooked rice. Make several shallow slashes in the skinless side of the salmon fillets. Place fillets skin-side down in a glass baking dish. In a medium bowl, whisk together the olive oil, rice vinegar, soy. ingredients.
