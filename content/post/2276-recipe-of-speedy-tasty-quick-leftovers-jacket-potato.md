- "1/2 red pepper"

- " Seasoning"
- " Butter for the potato if desired"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to around 200C. Pierce your washed potato in several places and stick in the microwave on high for about 5 minutes."
- "Carefully pour about a tablespoon of oil (whichever you prefer but veg/sunflower oils are best for high heats) over the potato making sure it&#39;s coated all over &amp; add a sprinkle of salt and pop into the oven on a baking tray."
- "While the potato is in the oven check out your fridge, if you&#39;re like me you always have assorted veggies leftover that will go really well with a baked potato! I like to use raw crunchy veg piled on top of a fluffy potato. Cut the veg into chunks and add the Tuna and seasoning, then mix in a bowl with a dollop of mayo."
- "Check on the potato, it should be crisping up nicely. Once the skin is golden and a fork goes in easily it&#39;s done. If you fancy it add some butter to your jacket then pile on the veggie tuna mix. Grate some cheddar or Parmesan on top."
