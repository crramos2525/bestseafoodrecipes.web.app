Of course, it has a generous layer of more sauce and cheese to top it all off. Serve the cannelloni with extra tomato sauce from the baking dish and garnish with fresh basil. Cannelloni has to be smothered generously with sauce to ensure there&#39;s enough liquid for the dry pasta tubes to absorb and cook in the oven. The most common sauce is a tomato pasta sauce which is what I use. Add cream, roma tomatoes, cheese, dry herbs and basil.
