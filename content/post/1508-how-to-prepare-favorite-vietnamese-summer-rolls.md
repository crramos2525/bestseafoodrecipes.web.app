- "Cook the noodles: Add water in a saucepan and bring it to boil, then turn off the heat, add the noodles, and let sit until tender, about 5 minutes (check the package directions for times). Some noodle you can just pour hot water in and leave in for 5-8 min. Drain the noodles, transfer them to a bowl, add the sesame oil, and toss to combine, use kitchen scissors or knife cut them into shorter pieces; set aside."
- "Soften a wrapper: Fill a plate halfway with room-temperature water. Place 1 wrapper in the water until it softens, about 15 seconds. Use both hands to pull it up out of the water, being careful so it doesn&#39;t collapse on itself, and immediately lay it flat on a clean work surface."
- "Fill the wrapper: Place 2 to 3 mint or basil leaves down the wrapper, just slightly to the left of centre. Place 3 to 4 pieces of prawns cut-side up on the herbs. Place a piece of lettuce in your hand, then fill evenly with 1/4 cup of the vegetable mixture and 1 to 2 tablespoons of noodles. Place the lettuce cup to the right of the shrimp, leaving a small gap."
- "Roll up the summer roll: Fold the top and bottom of the wrapper over the filling. Fold the left side over the shrimp and continue rolling tightly to the right until it&#39;s closed and snug. Place it on a baking sheet seam-side down and cover with a damp towel. Repeat with the remaining wrappers and filling, adding more water to the pie dish as needed. You can add some edible flowers ie pansy on too to make them look pretty."
- "Serve: To serve, cut each roll in half crosswise if desired and serve with sweet chilli sauce or A-jard sauce and some fresh vegetables and herbs"
