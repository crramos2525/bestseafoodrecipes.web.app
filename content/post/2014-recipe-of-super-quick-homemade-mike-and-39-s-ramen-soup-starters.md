This ramen comes already seasoned with a perfect blend of spices — including hints of ginger, tamari and mushrooms — that lets you quickly and easily whip up a Japanese-inspired meal. Just add in some wheat noodles, onions, bean sprouts, your protein of choice and spritz with lime for a delicious and. Imagine ramen as a living organism. If soup represents the body of ramen, and noodles are the bones, then tare is the blood.
