Poke (pronounced: POH-keh) bowls are a Hawaiian invention made by layering raw fish (often tuna) tossed with a light sauce and vegetables over cooked rice. Substitute canned tuna for the fresh. Well, Poke Bowls they&#39;re a bit like sushi, except they&#39;re deconstructed, so they&#39;re super easy to make! Once cubed, add the tuna to the bowl and stir gently to coat the fish. I love the combination of poke, hot rice, and cold vinegary vegetables.
