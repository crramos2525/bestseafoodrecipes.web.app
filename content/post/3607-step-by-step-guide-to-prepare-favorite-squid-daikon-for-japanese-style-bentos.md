- "Score the squid with a diamond pattern, then cut into easy-to-eat sized pieces.  Sprinkle with a little sake (not listed in the ingredients)."
- "Daikon. Peel and cut into bite sized chunks.  Add about 2 tablespoons of water (not listed in the ingredients) and cover with plastic wrap. Microwave for 5 minutes, turn the dish, and microwave for an additional 5 minutes."

- "Continue boiling on high. It&#39;s done when the liquid has mostly simmered away.   The surface should have a slight sheen.  It&#39;s good to eat now, as is."

- "Dissolve a little katakuriko in 50 ml of water (not listed). Put this in the pan with the squid and daikon, and quickly heat one more time. Cool as is, without discarding the liquid, and it&#39;s done!"
