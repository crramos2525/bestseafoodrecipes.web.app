One time I had pineapple,tuna and sweetcorn on pizza at Pizza Hut. It sounded wrong but tasted really good to me. Do you think that&#39;s gross, matter of opinion or normal? Fish pizza sounds counter intuitive, but if a person thinks about it, pizza is just a flatbread with ingredients on it.

This amazing pizza is topped with sweet and juicy pineapples, spruced up with a sprinkling of peppy herbs and spice powders. A tongue-tickling mix of cubed tofu and soy sauce boosts the taste of the pizza and also adds another interesting texture to it. Laced with Oriental sauces like hoisin sauce and. Fresh tuna loin is grilled to perfection and sliced to be combined in tortilla wraps with pineapple, chili and cilantro flavored rice. For me, pineapple pizza (AKA Hawaiian pizza â€” though not actually invented in Hawaii but Canada Hawaiian pizza - Wikipedia. ) is far less tasty than even a traditional margarita.
