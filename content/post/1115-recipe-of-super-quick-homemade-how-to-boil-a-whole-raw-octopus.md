recipeinstructions:
- "There are different kinds of octopus, but I&#39;m not sure if this is a madako type... I&#39;m a Hakotade native, which is prominent for squid, so I&#39;m not too sure about octopus varieties."
- "This is a photo of the suckers. Unnecessary?"
- "If you buy an octopus from a fishmonger, the insides of the head, the eyes and the beak will most likely be removed."
- "Place the octopus on a sieve, add lots of salt and rub in with both hands to clean. Enjoy the feeling of the suckers sticking to your hands!"
- "Apparently fishermen put an octopus in a plastic bag with salt, and spin it for 45 minutes in a washing machine. Think of emulating that as you rub that beast very, very well."
- "When it&#39;s no longer slimy, rinse well in water."
- "I heard that the octopus becomes tender if you bash with a daikon radish so I tried it out, but there wasn&#39;t a lot of difference between an un-bashed tentacle. In any case, the octopus did becomes somewhat tender."
- "A sushi chef told me that if you boil octopus with bancha green tea, it adds color, the skin doesn&#39;t peel off easily, and that the texture of the flesh is improved, so I tried out the tip."
- "The key to making the legs roll up nicely is to submerge in the boiling water tentacle first, take out, putting back in, and repeating several times."
- "When the tentacles have rolled up cutely, put the whole thing in the boiling water."
- "You can adjust the boiling time, but if you boil it for too long it will become tough. I boiled a 1.2 kg octopus for about 5 minutes."
- "Take it out when it&#39;s boiled, place in a sieve and cool under running water."
- "Cool down quickly in ice water, until it&#39;s no longer warm when you touch it."
- "Chop off the tentacles one by one."
- "The head. The mouth is cute!"
- "After a 5 minute boil, the texture is like this. I think it&#39;s perfect for sashimi or carpaccio."
- "As long as you rub it very well with salt until it&#39;s no longer slimy, I think it&#39;s hard to screw up."
- "Enjoy as sashimi and carpaccio, and use the rest in simmered dishes and enjoy!"
