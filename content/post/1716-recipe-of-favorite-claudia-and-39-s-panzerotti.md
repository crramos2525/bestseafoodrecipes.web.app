recipeingredient:
- " For the dough"
- "220 ml warm water"
- "1 tsp sugar"
- "20 g fresh yeast or 6g dried yeast"
- "400 g plain flour"
- "1 tsp salt"
- "30 g extra virgin olive oil"
- " For the tuna filling"
- "1 large onion"
- "2 cans tuna"
- " Small glass of water"
- "2 tbsp olive oil"
- " For the mozzarella filling"
- "300 g mozzarella"
- "400 g tin plum tomatoes"
- "Pinch salt"
- "2 tbsp olive oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Start by preparing the fillings. Drain the tomatoes and tuna and put into separate bowls. Chop the mozzarella into small pieces and place into a third bowl. Do this 3 hours before you start cooking the panzerotti. This is a very important step as you don&#39;t want the filling to be full of liquid and the panzerotti to break when frying."
- "Put the flour on the worktop to create a volcano like shape. Add the sugar and the yeast."
- "Add the oil and start bringing flour from the outside to the inside. Slowly add the water and the salt. Work the dough for about 15 min until obtaining an elastic and smooth dough."
- "Stretch the dough and cut it in half long ways. Cut some pieces of 50g each and roll them into a ball."
- "You should make about 12 balls. Cover them with a clean cloth and let the dough rise for 2 hours."
- "In the meantime, start preparing the onion for the tuna filling. Slice the onion. Warm up a pan, add some oil then add the onion. Fry the onions for a couple of minutes and add the water. Cover and cook for 15 minutes or until soft and all water has evaporated. Leave it to cool down."
- "Return to your fillings. Mix the mozzarella and tomato together and mix the tuna with the onion. Uncover the dough balls and flatten each one to create circles about 2mm thick."
- "Add a spoonful of filling to the middle of each circle. Use a brush with a little water and wet half of the edge of the dough. Fold the dough over to make a half moon shape and press very hard to make sure they won&#39;t open when frying. Fry a maximum of 2 at a time so the temperature doesn&#39;t drop too much. Take them out when they look nice and golden."
- "The end result should look like this."
- "Try the one with nutella. Follow the same process but add a spoonful of nutella for the filling instead. Sprinkle icing sugar on the top."
