- "Add oil to a pan (not listed), and fry the tofu. Once the tofu has browned a bit, transfer it to a plate (you can also just warm the tofu up in the microwave instead of frying. However, make sure to remove the water.)"
- "Add oil (not listed) to the pan from Step 2 (it&#39;s okay if there is a little tofu remaining), add in the beat eggs, and scramble them until they are about halfway cooked. Put them on top of the tofu from Step 2."
- "Add in the mixed ingredients marked with ● into the pan (it&#39;s okay if some egg is left) from Step 3, And heat it up while stirring until it thickens. Put this on top of the eggs from Step 3."
- "Edit: When cooking the tofu in step one, frying it up with diagonally-cut white leaks also tastes great. It gives it a nice crunchy texture."
- "It also tastes great on top of rice."
