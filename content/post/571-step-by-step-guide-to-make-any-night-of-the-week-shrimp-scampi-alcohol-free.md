recipeingredient:
- "250 grams angel hair pasta"
- "500 grams shrimp"
- "1 tbsp olive oil"
- "100 grams butter"
- "2 tbsp minced garlic"
- "2 tsp chopped chives dry or fresh"
- "Half a lemon squeezed"
- " Salt to taste"
recipeinstructions:
- "Measure and prepare all the ingredients above"
- "In a medium saucepan boil water and cook the angel hair pasta until cooked but firm (al dente). Sieve pasta and set aside. I usually pour a little olive oil into the cooked pasta to coat it so it won’t dry out while I prepare the shrimp and sauce. Note: The pasta is best al dente because you will be cooking it lightly again in the sauce later which will soften it a little and mix well with the sauce."
- "In a large non stick frying pan, heat the olive oil for about 20 seconds and slowly place the butter carefully in the oil. Add the shrimp to the butter and let it cook until the shrimp turns pink. Take the shrimp out and set aside."
- "Add garlic to the large pan with the remaining butter and oil and sauté until fragrant (don’t let the garlic burn). You can add a little more oil or butter if you feel like the sauce has dried out a bit."
- "Squeeze half a lemon into the garlic butter sauce. Toss in the cooked pasta and coat evenly with the sauce. Add the shrimp to the pasta and season with salt and chives. Give it all a good mix. You can always add pepper or any other seasoning, but I usually make this for kids so I keep it minimal and add my own spices before I eat it :)"
