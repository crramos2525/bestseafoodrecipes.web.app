I was looking for a recipe that had similar dressing to the roasted red pepper they serve at the salad chain Mad Greens. For the red pepper dressing, place the red pepper under a grill unit&#39;s highest setting. Turn occasionally, until blackened all over. Allow to cool before peeling off the skin, then chop the flesh and place into a food processor along with the remaining dressing ingredients.
