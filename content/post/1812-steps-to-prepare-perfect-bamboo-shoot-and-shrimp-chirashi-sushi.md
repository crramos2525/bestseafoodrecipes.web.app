recipeinstructions:

- "[Simmer the mixed ingredients] Reconstitute the dried shiitake mushrooms and koya dofu by soaking in lukewarm water, then drain. Cut the shiitake mushrooms, koya dofu, carrot, and bamboo shoot into small pieces, and set aside. The bamboo shoots should be cut a little larger than the other items.

Mixing the rice and vinegar with a spatula, using a cutting motion."
- "Add the simmered ingredients from Step 2 to the sushi rice from Step 3, toasted white sesame seeds, and mix well. When it&#39;s evenly mixed, scatter on the julienned egg crepe, add the chopped shrimp and snow peas on top, and it&#39;s done."
- "Add further toppings as you like. Garnish with nanohana, slices of raw fish, etc., to taste. I prefer my sushi rice a little on the tart side. If you don&#39;t like it so tart, just cut back on the amount of vinegar a bit."
