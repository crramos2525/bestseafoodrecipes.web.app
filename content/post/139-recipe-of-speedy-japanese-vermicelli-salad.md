recipeinstructions:
- "Boil water in a large pan. All at once, pour the vermicelli in and stir until cooked. It&#39;s really quick and it should not be overcooked. No more than 4 minutes. See packaging instructions."
- "Drain the water and immediately rinse it with cold water, until it&#39;s completely cold. Drain it and put it in a large bowl."
- "Make the omelettes. They should be thin ones, to be rolled and sliced."
- "Use a slicer for the carrots and the cucumber. I have a Benriner and it&#39;s great because it has interchangeable blades and also adjustable to make very thin slices."
- "Separate the stripes of the kanikama, it doesn&#39;t need to be perfect. Add the carrots, the cucumber, the omelette and the kanikama to the noodles."
- "Dilute the sugar in the vinegar. Season the salad with the vinegar, soy sauce and toasted sesame oil. Mix it well with your hands. This bit is quite messy but I haven&#39;t found a better way yet, I sometimes use gloves but I don&#39;t mind washing my hands after, it&#39;s all part of the fun! Enjoy!"
