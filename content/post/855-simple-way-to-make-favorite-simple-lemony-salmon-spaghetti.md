- "After adding all the spices, bring back the cooked salmon and add 1 squeezed lemon to the mixture. Give it few minutes to smell all the flavors together then start adding spaghetti. I try not to overwhelm it with spaghetti. Drizzle more olive oil to the mix. Aside sautÃ© pine nuts in olive oil."
- "Now for the Arugula, take another pan, drizzle olive oil, add arugula just for 1 minute maximum on a low heat add some pinch of salt, lemon and remove. You want to keep the arugula fresh but just blended with the lemon, salt and olive oil. This is the amazing part of the recipe. Do not mix Arugula with Spaghetti but just leave it to add on top of the spaghetti in the plate. Add the yummy pine nuts, flax seeds, chia seeds and you are good to go with a yummy fantastic taste.
