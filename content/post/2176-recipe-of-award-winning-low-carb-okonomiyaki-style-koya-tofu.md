recipeingredient:
- "3 large  about 50 grams  Koya dofu"
- "1 bag  150 grams  Bean sprouts see Step 1"
- "100 grams Pork see Step 1"
- "2 about 100 grams  Egg medium"
- "1 packet  3 grams  Bonito flakes"
- "3 grams Small shrimp"
- "1 pinch or so Salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "I used these additions to the batter this time: thinly sliced pork, and black bran bean sprouts (0 g sugar per 100 g). Cut the pork up into easy to eat pieces."
- "Soak the koya dofu in plenty of water for 10 to 15 mnutes. Squeeze out each piece until it weighs around 40 to 45 g (so no more moisture comes out when you squeeze them)."
- "Rip up the koya dofu, and put in a food processor with the ☆ ingredients. Process until smooth and you don&#39;t see any chunks of koya tofu left. Transfer the batter to a bowl."
- "Put the bean sprouts in the food processor and chop them up by pulsing the machine twice. If you over-chop, they&#39;ll make the batter too watery."
- "Put the pork from Step 1 and the bean sprouts from Step 4 into the bowl with the battter, and fold them in with a spatula. The batter will look very crumbly at this stage, unlike regular okonomiyaki batter."
- "Heat up a frying pan and spread some oil in it if needed. Ladle 1/4 each of the batter into the pan twice (2 pancakes). Form each pancake into neat circles with a spatula, cover with a lid and steam-fry."
- "Cook the pancakes over medium heat for 5 minutes until well browned, and then turn them over. Cook them on the other side over low-medium heat for about 4 minutes with the lid on. Cook the remaining batter in the same way."
- "The pancakes will be moist. Serve with okonomiyaki sauce, mayonnaise and aonori powder. They are also delicious topped with cheese and steam-fried until the cheese has melted."
- "I tried replacing half the bean sprouts with rather thickly shredded salad greens. The crispy texture was great."
