recipeinstructions:

- "In a medium bowl, gently combine the tuna with soy sauce and sesame oil."
- "Slice the carrot into thin layers and slice up your shrimp sticks into small pieces."
- "Mix the shrimp with a little bit mayonnaise. Your shrimp salad is ready!"
- "Spoon the slightly cooled rice (rather a little warm, then cold) into bowls.  Divide the tuna, carrot slices, corns, edamame beans, and the shrimp salad on this."
- "Top the poke bowl with sesame seeds and possibly chili flakes and serve immediately."
- "Enjoy!"
