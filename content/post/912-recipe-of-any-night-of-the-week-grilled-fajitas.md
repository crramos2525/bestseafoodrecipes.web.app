It&#39;s my favorite beef fajita recipe, by far! Grilling the beef really makes a difference in flavor and the blend of spices are perfect. However, if you don&#39;t want to grill, the beef can be done using a cast iron pan on the stovetop. The beef will have a more intense flavor if you let it sit in the refrigerator for a few.

TO GRILL THE STEAK FAJITAS: â€¦ON A CHARCOAL GRILL: If using a charcoal grill: fill one grill chimney with charcoal and light it. When top coals are mostly covered with gray ash, pour the coals over one side of the charcoal grate. Clean and oil the grill after the grill preheats. For the Fajita Marinade: Combine soy sauce, lime juice, canola oil, brown sugar, cumin, black pepper, chili powder, and garlic in a medium bowl and whisk to combine. They&#39;re usually served with flour tortillas on the side and other condiments like guacamole, salsa, sour cream and/or cheese that can be rolled into the tortillas with the meat.
