While I travel, I sometimes see napa cabbage sold at local markets, but it&#39;s not available in many. Your special batch will arrive vacuum sealed with a gel pack and an insulated bag via priority mail. Nowadays, kimchi is made both in North and South Korea, the Southern version being more salty and spicy than the Northern one. Seasons also play a role in the flavors of kimchi - refreshing cucumber. Nearby restaurants are no good, either; their kimchi is missing that characteristic funk.
