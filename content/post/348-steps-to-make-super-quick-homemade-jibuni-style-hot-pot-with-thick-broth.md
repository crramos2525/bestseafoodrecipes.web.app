recipeinstructions:

- "Cut the Japanese leeks and skewer between the pieces of meat. Add oil to a frying pan and fry the skewers on both sides to seal in the umami flavor."
- "They&#39;ll boil in the pot later, so at this point, just cook the skewers until they&#39;re 60-70% done. You could use pork or beef instead of chicken. The skewers in the photo were made with pork shoulder."
- "Wash the taro root and microwave at 600 W for 5-6 minutes. Peel and cut in half. The size of the taro root will change cooking time so adjust for your microwave."
- "Divide the Chinese cabbage leaves from the stems. Roughly chop the leaves and cut the stems into thin strips, almost to a julienne, so they cook easily."
- "Cut the bok choy the same way as the Chinese cabbage. Julienne the carrots with a slicer or a knife. Cut the chikuwa into bite-size pieces."

- "Serve in individual bowls. Eat with the ★ ingredients and enjoy. If the flavor of the broth gets too concentrated, add water."
- "For the &#34;shime&#34; (the end of the meal), boil udon noodles, harusame noodles, soba noodles, or somen noodles in the broth. Any kind of noodles go well. I would also recommend cooking mochi cakes by dipping them in the boiling broth (&#34;shabu-shabu&#34;)."
- "Of course, adding rice, eggs and green onions  to the broth is also good. Top with shredded nori seaweed sheets or crushed sesame seeds if you like."
- "If you&#39;re using any ingredients that release scum or takes a long time to cook, blanch first. Add any ingredients you like."
