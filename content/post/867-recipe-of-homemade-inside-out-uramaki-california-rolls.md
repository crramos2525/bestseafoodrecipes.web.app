To make uramaki, you need plastic wrap to prevent rice from sticking to the sushi mat. There are various methods of doing this, but I like to completely cover the mat with the plastic wrap and taping the ends. Sushi rolls, or &#39;makizushi&#39; in Japanese, are what most non-Japanese people think of when they think of sushi. Makizushi is made by wrapping up fillings in rice and nori This recipe shows you how to make a basic uramaki inside out sushi roll. Great for making multiple ones with your favourite fillings.
