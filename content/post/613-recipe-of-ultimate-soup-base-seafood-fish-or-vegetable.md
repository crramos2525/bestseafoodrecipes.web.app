recipeinstructions:
- "Use fat or butter to brown your shells, fish or vegetables. Once sufficiently browned (about 5-6 minutes) add the salt and half the water (2 quarts)."
- "Let reduce to about 2 cups of water over low to medium heat. If you are watching it then you can use higher temperatures."
- "Add rest of water and reduce to about 1 quart."
