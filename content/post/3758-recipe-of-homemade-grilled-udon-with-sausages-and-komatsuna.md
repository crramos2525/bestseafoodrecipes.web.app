##### Instructions to make Grilled Udon with Sausages and Komatsuna:

Add onion and garlic to sausage as it cooks. At the same time, cook egg noodles according to package instructions. After draining noodles, return them to the pot and add the sausage, onion, garlic combination. Every spring and fall, I grow a beautiful bed of komatsuna (Brassica rapa var. perviridis), a type of Japanese mustard green related to turnip and rapini. It&#39;s the fastest growing green in my garden (ready to harvest as baby greens within three weeks, fully mature by five weeks), and its spicy, mustardy leaves can be picked at any stage.
