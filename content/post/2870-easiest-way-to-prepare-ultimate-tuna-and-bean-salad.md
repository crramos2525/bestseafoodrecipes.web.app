Hello everybody, it is me again, Dan, welcome to our recipe site. Today, I'm gonna show you how to make a special dish, tuna and bean salad. One of my favorites. For mine, I will make it a little bit tasty. This will be really delicious.

Tuna and bean salad is one of the most well liked of recent trending meals on earth. It's enjoyed by millions daily. It is easy, it is quick, it tastes yummy. They're fine and they look fantastic. Tuna and bean salad is something that I've loved my entire life.

Budget Canned Tuna Tuna Salad White Bean. Simple tuna and white bean salad, a classic combination and so easy to make! Some items that you will almost always find well stocked in our pantry are canned beans (white beans, garbanzo, kidney) and canned.

##### The ingredients needed to make Tuna and bean salad:

1. Take 1 15 0z can of Great Northern beans rinsed and drained
1. Take 1 (5 oz) can of water-packed tuna
1. Prepare  Good dash chili powder
1. Prepare  Good dash of ground cumin
1. Make ready  Good dash of garlic powder
1. Make ready  Good dash of tajin clasico seasoning with lime
1. Prepare  Good dash of Dill
1. Make ready  Good dash of salt and pepper
1. Make ready  Light drizzling of olive oil


The salad packs a lot of protein, not just from the beans, but also from the tuna, which is also an excellent. Purists would insist on imported Italian canned tuna fish for the Tuscan classic, but we think plain old tuna from the supermarket is just fine, too. Green beans, chunks of tuna, and white kidney beans are mixed with olive oil, lemon juice, and a bit of garlic. After a few hours in the fridge, this Italian I used albacore tuna and served on baby spinich as a salad.

Will make again when craving a different tuna salad. May try with kidney beans next. This classic Italian salad marries cooked white beans and oil-packed tuna for a protein-packed, pantry-friendly, light meal that&#39;s perfect for warm weather. The vinegar used to marinate the onions and the juice that the onions release in the process together form the base of the dressing for the salad.
