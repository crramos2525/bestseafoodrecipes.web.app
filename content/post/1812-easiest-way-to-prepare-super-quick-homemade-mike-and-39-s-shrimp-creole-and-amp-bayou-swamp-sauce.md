- "For shrimp brine"
- "Add 1 cup hot water, 4 tbs kosher salt and 3 tbs granulated sugar to a plastic bowl. Mix well until completely dissolved."
- "Place uncooked, frozen shrimp in bowl and add 4 cups of ice to it. Brine should be at 36° - 40° to be effective. Also, add just enough cold water to totally cover shrimp.

- "Quickly peel shrimp and add to simmering Bayou Swamp Sauce. Let simmer on low for 2 minutes. Your shrimp will absorb the Creole seasonings as they tighten up. Stir occasionally."
- "Serve with sides of Tabasco Or Louisiana Hot Sauce and garnish plate with fresh chopped Parsley and Chives."
- "Chef&#39;s Note: Make certain you stir this dish well before serving each bowl. If not, all solid ingredients will sink to the bottom of the sauce pan once motion has stopped. At that point, all the oil from the butter will rise to the top."
- "For your garlic spread"
- "Evenly slice French Bread into 3&#34; thick slices."
- "Mix all ingredients in the Garlic Butter Seasoning category together very well. Slightly heat in microwave if need be."
- "Place bread on cookie sheet butter side down. Lightly sprinkle bread slices with Paprika for both color and spice if desired."
- "Bake 15 minutes at 350° or, until they&#39;re crispy and golden brown. Be careful to not over bake."
- "Enjoy!"
