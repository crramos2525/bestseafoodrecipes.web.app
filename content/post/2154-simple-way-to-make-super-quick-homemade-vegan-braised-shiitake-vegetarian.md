I halved the recipe to use up some baby bok choy and shiitakes that I had on hand from another recipe. This of course decreased the liquid to the point that the extra time to reduce the sauce wasn&#39;t needed.

Shiitake mushrooms are packed with B vitamins and have the power to fight cancer cells, cardiovascular disease and infections.
