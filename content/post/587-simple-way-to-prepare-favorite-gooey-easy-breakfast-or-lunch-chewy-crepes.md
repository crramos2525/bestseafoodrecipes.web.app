- "Once you feel that the cheese has melted, it&#39;s done."
- "By the way, for the fillings in these I used yesterday&#39;s leftover sweet and salty beef with cheese."
- "[Note] Everything is just approximate but cook one side for 1-1.5 minutes, turn it over, and cook the other side for 30-60 seconds."
- "Depending on how I&#39;m feeling or the fillings I&#39;m using, I sometimes cook them until they become crispy. Adjust the cooking time if you want them to be more chewy. Just cook them as you like."
