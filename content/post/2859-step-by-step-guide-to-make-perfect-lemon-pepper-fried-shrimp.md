recipeinstructions:
- "Set up your station with 3 bowls, one for your flour, one for your egg wash and one for your shrimp. Next, set up your pot for the oil you&#39;ll be using to fry and set on the stove."
- "Next, begin shelling and cleaning your shrimp. Once all the shells have been removed and the shrimp has been cleaned, place in a bowl and add your seasoning, mixing it in with the shrimp. Your oil should be at medium-high heat by this time."
- "Now you can do your flour/egg wash one of two ways. You can dip the shrimp in egg wash, then the flour and then to the heated oil or for a crunchier shrimp, do flour, egg wash, then flour again. Repeat process until all shrimp is fried. Usually when they are done, they float to the top about 3-4 minutes of cooking."
- "Place on a paper plate lined with paper towel to catch remaining oil and top with either Parsley or Scallions then serve. I used Parsley this time around."
