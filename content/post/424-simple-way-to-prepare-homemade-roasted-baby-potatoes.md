recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 200 degrees celsius or 400 fahrenheit.  Wash the potatoes thoroughly.  *I prefer mine with skins on. You can peel the skins off if desired.*"

- "Pass the mixture thru&#39; a strainer over a large bowl.  *Do no discard the residue.*  Once the potatoes are cooked to fork tender, drain and transfer onto a working surface.  Using a sharp knife, slice the potatoes in half, but not all the way thru&#39;.  *Careful as the potatoes are still piping hot. Wear a heat proof glove.*"
- "Transfer the potatoes into the bowl of the oil.  Toss to coat the potatoes well.  Transfer everything, including any leftover oil, onto a baking tray.  Season generously with salt and pepper."
- "Give it a final toss to combine well.  Wack into the oven and bake for 15 to 20 mins.  Remove from oven and flip the potatoes.  Return to the oven and bake for another 10 to 15 mins or until the skins start to wrinkle and slightly crispy."
