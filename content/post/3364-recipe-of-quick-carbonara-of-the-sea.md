Carbonara (Italian: [karboˈnaːra]) is an Italian pasta dish from Rome made with egg, hard cheese, cured pork, and black pepper. The dish arrived at its modern form, with its current name. However, Filipino style carbonara uses cream and milk, for this dish we added tuna to make it healthier and tastier.

Quizás para los que estén más acostumbrados a la otra receta les resultará raro esta receta de carbonara sin nata pero la primera carbonara que probé fue ésta y para mi es la salsa clásica aunque puedes encontrar muchas variantes (como usar el huevo entero o añadirle nata pero no cebolla). The majority of chefs agree that &#34;true&#34; carbonara has guanciale and not bacon or pancetta, although both make fine substitutions. The key to good spaghetti alla carbonara, like any good piece of cooking (and especially this one), is the quality of the ingredients. Roasted Cabbage Carbonara: Roasted cabbage slices has become an extremely popular recipe around the internet! This is my favorite recipe Hi I am Vivica, welcome to my blog!
