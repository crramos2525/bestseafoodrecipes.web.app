recipeinstructions:
- "When buying fresh, it can be hit or miss if you don&#39;t have a favorite trusted place to buy, but there are some things to look for as you choose: For shrimp (often from frozen): Should be firm and clear from spotting. Buying whole will add extra flavoring to the broth."
- "For squid (often from frozen): Should be firm, in first stage of defrost, on ice. There is some prep before adding to soup."
- "For clams: Clams, get fresh when possible. If the clam &#34;spits&#34; at you, it&#39;s fresh."
- "This is an example of a dead clam:"
- "For fish: Look at the eyes. You want clear."
- "If cloudy, he&#39;s been there a while:"
- "Marinade for seafood: Put squid in bowl."
- "Prepare squid: Pull out head."
- "Cut of head tentacles and remove beak."
- "Pull out pen. (quill)"
- "Clean out all internal flesh with your fingers or running under cold water."
- "Remove the outer skin (optional)"
- "Slice into rings."
- "Discard rest."
- "Add to separate bowl to marinate with fish."
- "Cut fish into bite sized chunks and add to squid."
- "Sprinkle seafood lightly with a pinch of ground cumin, ground mustard and ground coriander and a dash of chili powder. Mix well with some olive oil, cover and put back in fridge until ready to use."
- "Combine stock ingredients. Bring to a boil, then remove from heat and allow flavors to blend."
- "Prepare the vegetables."
- "Dice the onion."
- "Dice zucchini."
- "Dice peppers."
- "Dice hot peppers."
- "Jalapeño peppers vary in heat. For hot, look for lines on the pepper."
- "For milder heat, use chile manzano or &#34;apple pepper.&#34; You want a nice bright color all around."
- "Look for bright, shiny and firm, if browning, not fresh."
- "Mince the garlic."
- "In large pot, add 3 tbs extra virgin olive oil, sauté onion and peppers until onion is translucent, then add zucchini and the garlic continue stirring."
- "Place all of the spice blend ingredients into a pot, bring to a boil and remove from heat. Allow to sit 30 minutes and then blend with an electric mixer until smooth."
