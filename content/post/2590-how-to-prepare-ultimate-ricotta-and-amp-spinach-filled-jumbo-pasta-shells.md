Line a large sieve with a layer of heavy-duty (fine-mesh) cheesecloth and place it over a large bowl. Fresh ricotta may be an uncomplicated cheese, but it&#39;s far from plain. Serve a fluffy mound of it with bread instead of butter, add it to a bowl of pasta, pair it with fruit, and incorporate it into desserts. But ricotta is also a fantastic ingredient to add straight-up to a dish.

Dollops of ricotta on top of pasta, soup, or pizza bring freshness (and definitely more richness) instantly. Making Fresh Ricotta Salata: If you&#39;d like to make a fresh farmer&#39;s cheese (ricotta salata) from this ricotta, wrap it in cheese cloth and press it beneath a weighted plate in the refrigerator overnight. Using the Leftover Whey: The leftover whey can be used in place of water in any baking recipe, whizzed into smoothies, or drunk on its own. Ricotta and cream cheeses give every bit as much flavor as cheesecake without the effort. Instead of making individual servings, you could layer the ingredients in a glass serving bowl. —Taste of Home Test Kitchen.
