recipeinstructions:
- "Cook the egg noodles in a large pot of salted boiling water according to package directions. Once it&#39;s done, drain it and toss it lightly with olive oil to prevent it from sticking. Set it aside. In the same pot, heat the butter over medium heat. Once it&#39;s melted, add the onion and cook until it&#39;s translucent, just about 3-4 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook just until fragrant."

- "Once it&#39;s bubbling, lower the heat back down and let it simmer until it&#39;s thickened enough to coat the back of a spoon. Then stir in the salt, pepper and peas. Slightly break up the tuna with a fork into large chunks and stir that in as well. Remove from the heat and stir in the cheese until it&#39;s melted in, then serve."
