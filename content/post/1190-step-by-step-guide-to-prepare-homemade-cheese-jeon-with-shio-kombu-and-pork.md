The Shio Kombu seaweed is great!!! Will buy again and would recommend to anyone needing it for a Oriental dish or spice. Kombu, a kelp seaweed with a robust flavor, thrives off the coasts of China, Japan and Korea. Because fresh kombu has a short shelf life, this seaweed is most often sold dried. One of this seaweed&#39;s most common uses is in a Japanese multipurpose stock, called dashi, which is used to create.
