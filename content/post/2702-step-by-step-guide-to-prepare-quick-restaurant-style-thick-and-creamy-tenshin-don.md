recipeingredient:
- "2 Eggs"
- "200 ml A Water"
- "1/2 tsp A Weipa"
- "1/2 to 1 teaspoon A Soy sauce"
- "1/2 tsp A Oyster sauce"
- "1/2 tsp A Sake"
- "1/2 tsp A Mirin"
- "1 just a tiny bit A Grated garlic"
- "1 bit less than 1 tablespoon A Sesame oil"
- "1 Salt and pepper"
- "2 tsp to 1 tablespoon Katakuriko"
- "1/6 Onion"
- "1 Shrimp canned crab crabsticks or whatever you like I used canned crab"
- "1 Green onions or leeks of your choice white leek green onions etc"
- "1 rice bowl full  White cooked rice"
recipeinstructions:
- "Chop the onion finely. If you are using large shrimp, cut into 2-3cm pieces."
- "Break the eggs into a bowl, add salt and pepper and beat."
- "Dissolve the katakuriko in twice the amount in water. If you prefer a thicker sauce, use 1 tablespoon of katakuriko."
- "Put all the A. ingredients in a pan and heat. Taste and add salt and pepper. Bring to a boil."
- "I use Weipa soup stock base, but if you don&#39;t have this use another chicken soup stock base and make 200 ml of soup with it."
- "When the step 4 sauce has come to a boil, stir with a ladle while you add the step 3 katakuriko dissolved in water little by little to make the ankake sauce."
- "Once you have a smooth, lump-free sauce, turn the heat off right away. ＊If you let it simmer for too long and it gets too salty, add a little water to adjust."
- "Put a generous amount of sesame oil in a frying pan, stir fry the Step 1 ingredients quickly and season with salt and pepper. Here I used shrimp."
- "Put the stir fried ingredients into the beaten egg from Step 2 oil and all, and mix well. If you are using canned crab, just stir fry the onion and add the crab, can liquids and all, into the beaten egg."
- "Crabsticks are treated like canned crab - just add them to the egg rather than stir frying them. By adding the oil that you stir fried the onion in, it&#39;ll be easier to make fluffy light scrambled eggs later."
- "Put 1 rice bowl full of white cooked rice in the serving dish or bowl. You can moisten a rice bowl, pack it tightly with rice and invert it on a plate - this makes a nice neat presentation."
- "Add some more sesame oil to the frying pan you used in Step 9, and heat until it&#39;s smoking."
- "At the same time, start re-heating the ankake sauce from Step 7 over low heat."
- "When the frying pan is very hot, add the Step 9 egg mixture all at once, and rapidly mix it up from the center with cooking chopsticks to cook."
- "When the egg is soft-set (the whites should be semi-translucent) slide it out of the frying pan right onto the rice."
- "The cooking time for the egg depends on how hot your cooktop can get, but it takes me about 15 seconds. Put the egg on the rice when it looks like the photo."
- "The inside is still liquid in step 16, but it will become nice and creamy very soon with residual heat. By just putting it on the bed of rice, it will form a nice rounded shape."
- "Pour the heated up ankake sauce from Step 13 over the egg, top with chopped green onion or leek, and it&#39;s done."
- "It may seem like there&#39;s too much ankake sauce to start. But it&#39;s just the right amount for 1 adult sized bowl of rice."
- "If you are from the Kanto (Tokyo) region and you just have to have vinegar in the sauce, add 1 tablespoon of rice vinegar. These days I like either version."
