- "4.	Roll each chilled dough out on a lightly floured surface (dust top with flour too) into a 14-inch circle, to about an 1/8-inch thickeness.

Pipe filling into cups and sprinkle with chocolate chips and dust with powdered sugar. For best results serve within 2 hours. Store in refrigerator."
- "6.	*Update - some have mentioned their dough being too thick and not elastic enough to keep a shape when rolling and cutting, so I&#39;bhi updated it to be 6 - 8 Tbsp of juice rather than just 6 Tbsp."
