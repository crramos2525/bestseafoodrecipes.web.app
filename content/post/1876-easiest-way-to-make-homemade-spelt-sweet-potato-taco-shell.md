recipeingredient:
- "1 Cup mashed Boniato sweet potato PLU4546 or other varities"
- "2 Cups Fresh milled Organic spelt flour"
- "1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar"
- "1 pinch salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "Steam several similar size Boniato sweet potato in a steamer or the top steamer in an Aroma rice cooker for 25 minutes or more until fork easily could get through"
- "Cool your sweet potato once cooked in a large plate until your hands can handle. Remove the peel of those sweet potatoes by hand and mash them in a measuring cup until you get 1 full cup. Transfer it into a mixing bowl."
- "Measure 2 cups of organic spelt flour and add them into the same mixing bowl. Add 1 teaspoon of raw organic apple cider vinegar. Mixing them well by hand or a mixer. Rest the dough in a ziplock bag for at least 6 hours in a warm spot. I typically use oven with the lamp on, it gives a nice temperature of around 90F."
- "After resting for a nice 6 hours, cut the dough into 4 equal parts. Roll each divided piece into a small ball, and flat it by hand and roll the dough into a 8-9 inch round taco shell."
- "Cook it on a flat pan on medium heat for 2 minutes each side until you see small or big bubbles puff up and the color turns to darker brown and aromatic. If you leave it longer with low heat, the shell will be more crispy."
- "As for fillings, I like to sauté some veggies with baked chicken or shredded pork. Cooked brown rice or beans would go very well with this shell. Top with fresh diced organic tomatoes and chopped cilantro. A touch of fresh lime juice would maximize the flavor profile."
