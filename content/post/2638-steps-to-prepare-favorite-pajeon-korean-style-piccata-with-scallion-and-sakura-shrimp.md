recipeingredient:
- "1 bundle  Scallions or green onions"
- "1 little less than 1 tablespoon  Flour"
- "4 pieces Red bell peppers thinly and vertically sliced"
- "25 grams Boiled sakura shrimp"
- "1  Egg"
- "1/2 tsp  Shio koji"
- "1 pinch  White pepper or black pepper"
- "1/2 tbsp Sesame oil"
- " For the Vinegar soy sauce"
- "1 tbsp  Soy sauce"
- "1/2 tbsp  Rice vinegar"
- "1 tsp  Lemon juice"
- "1 pinch  Red pepper powder"
- "1/2 tbsp  Ground sesame or chopped pine nuts"
recipeinstructions:
- "Mix the 〇 ingredients and prepare the vinegar soy sauce. It turns out more authentic Korean using roasted and chopped pine nuts instead of ground sesame seeds."
- "Cut the thinly and vertically sliced red bell peppers in halves. You may substitute the bell peppers with julienned carrots or dried chili pepper strands."
- "Cut off the root ends of the scallions (or green onions), wash, lightly drain and cut into half lengths. I used green onions this time."
- "Cut the length of the scallions from Step 3 in half, and arrange the directions with an equal balance of the white and green parts on both ends."
- "Slit a plastic bag down the center and place the scallions from Step 4 on top. This is the way to use a plastic bag instead of a tray, to minimize clean-up."
- "Sprinkle the ★ flour over the scallions from Step 5 and coat them evenly."
- "Whisk the ☆ egg in a bowl. Add the ☆ shio koji and the ☆ white pepper (or black pepper). Mix well."
- "Pour 1/3 of the egg mixture from Step 7 over the scallions from Step 6. Flip the scallions using the plastic bag so that the egg mixture will evenly coat the scallions."
- "In a large pan, heat the sesame oil, place the egg-coated scallions in the pan and reduce the heat to low."
- "Shape by spreading out the scallions. I made it into a 14 cm wide piccata. My pan size is 28 cm diameter (slightly on the large side)."
- "Once the piccata is shaped, sprinkle the sakura shrimp on top and press down on them. Pour in the remaining half of the egg mixture from Step 7."
- "Arrange the bell peppers from Step 2 on top. Make sure the heat is low enough not to burn the piccata."
- "Pour the rest of the egg mixture over the piccata from Step 12. Cook slowly over low heat."
- "Once it is browned, flip and pat lightly. Cook again slowly."
- "Now, it&#39;s ready to serve."
- "Trim the ends and cut into 8 pieces on a cutting board. Serve on a plate with the vinegar soy sauce from Step 1 on the side."
- "If the white part of the scallions are thick, cut them vertically so they can cook through well."
- "I used a home-made shio koji from 200 g of dried rice malt, 70 g of salt and 330 ml of water."
