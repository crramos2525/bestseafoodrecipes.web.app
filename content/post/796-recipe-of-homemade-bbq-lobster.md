recipeingredient:
- " live lobster"
- " ginger"
- " garlic"
- " Potatoes"
- " thyme"
- " Couple of nobs of butter"
- " small green chili"
recipeinstructions:
- "First find yourself a nice fresh lobster, you are looking at about 0.5kg for two people. This is the toughest part of the whole recipe you need to kill him - If you do this be prepared to follow this recipe closely and do him the honour he deserves by cooking him well and eating everything! Keep the lobster in a large container in the fridge covered in a damp cloth to keep him calm."
- "When you are ready to cook first pop the lobster in the freezer for 20 minutes to sedate him"
- "Take the lobster from the freezer, place on a board and uncurl the tail and legs. Place a tea towel over the tail and hold on to the tail. To cut through the head, locate the cross on top of the carapace/body shell and place the point of a large, sharp knife in the centre of the cross with the blade towards the head. Push down firmly so the knife penetrates the shell and cuts through the head, continue along the body until he is in half"
- "Remove the tomalley (gray), the roe (deep green), the feathery lungs, and the sack behind the head. If you can also the vein that runs through the tail."
- "Hit the claws with a hammer or something heavy just to get a couple of small cracks, nothing massive but we want the sauce to be able to find at way in during cooking."
- "At this point get the BBQ going - Coals only none of this gas nonsense."
- "Finely grate the garlic and ginger. Finely chop the chilli (remove some of the seeds if you don&#39;t want it too spicy). Mix these with the butter. We want this to be soft and melted so either pop on the BBQ for 5 mins or on the stove in a metal container."
- "Finely slice your potatoes"
- "You know your BBQ is the correct temperature to cook your lobster when you can place your hand at the height of the cooking area for 10 seconds. Any shorter it&#39;s too hot, any longer it is too cold."
- "Place your lobster shell side down on the BBQ along with the potatoes, these can be used to keep the lobster up straight. Spoon over a good amount of your sauce."
- "As the lobster cooks keep adding more sauce. Keep it up straight and it will all stay in the shell. Don&#39;t forget to add some on top of the cracks int he claws you created earlier."
- "Keep cooking until the meat turns white and is separating from the shell a little."
- "Garnish with sprigs of thyme. Serve with a side salad. Eat from the same plate as your friend and don&#39;t be afraid to get your hands messy! Do the Lobster justice and eat everything, if the legs are nicely BBQ&#39;d you can eat these too, there will be some beautiful meat in the claws."
