recipeinstructions:
- "Wash the sushi rice under running water. Add the rice to the pan and bring the water to the boil. Reduce heat, cover with a lid and simmer for 35 minutes. Turn off the heat and allow to steam for a further 10 minutes. If you feel that the water has absorbed, turn off the heat a little earlier rather than burn it to the bottom."
- "Season the sushi rice with a splash of mirin and rice wine vinegar and gently mix through."
- "Mix the mushroom dressing by combining the ingredients and lightly whisking. Taste and adjust to get the right balance of flavours"

The mushrooms will go nice and sticky but be careful not to burn. You can also cook in the oven but you might like to use a little extra dressing so that they do not dry out."
- "Place a portion of rice in your bowl. Top with the mushrooms and a sprinkle with the Aonori. Season with a splash of ponzu or tamari and a wedge of lime if you wish. Enjoy :)"
