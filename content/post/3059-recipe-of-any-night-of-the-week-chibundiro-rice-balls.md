Japanese rice balls, also known as onigiri or omusubi, are a staple of Japanese lunch boxes (bento). They are usually shaped into rounds or triangles by hand, and they&#39;re fun to make and eat. Much like sandwiches in the West, onigiri is readily available in convenience stores across Japan, and it&#39;s great for a quick and easy savory snack. Dip each rice ball into the egg and oil mixture, then roll around to coat in the bread crumbs. Drain on paper towel, and serve hot.
