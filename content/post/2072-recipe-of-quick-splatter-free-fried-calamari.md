recipeingredient:
- " Squid"
- " Milk"
- " Grated ginger or garlic"
- " Plain flour"
- " Egg"
- " Soy sauce"
- " Pepper"
- " Panko dried"
- " Frying oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Gently remove the innards from the squid. Once you have cleaned it out, peel the thin membrane. I am not going to use the legs and fins this time."
- "A tip to prevent oil splattering is to remove the thin membrane. Make shallow, vertical cuts in the backside and use a paper towel to peel off."
- "The main reason why oil splatters is due to the moisture content in the squid."
- "Pat dry and then brine in soy sauce. This helps drain the water."
- "Take the squid from Step 4 and mix it with the listed amount of flour. Combine with garlic, soy sauce, salt, pepper, and milk, then mix."
- "You could use ginger instead of garlic for the seasoning. Let it marinate for a bit and then add in the egg and a little bit of flour. The coating should be a little thicker than normal."
- "Instead of adding in all the flour at once, use your judgement to add more as necessary."
- "Coat the squid entirely with panko so that the water content from the squid won&#39;t leak."
- "Heat 2-3 cm of oil in a frying pan. Then drop the squid rings into the oil and fry. Be sure to have the heat on medium!"
- "If you don&#39;t have enough oil, it becomes difficult to cook the squid because the temperature will fluctuate. Use a generous amount of oil."
- "If you cook them for too long, they will be hard on the inside. I recommend cooking for about 1-1.5 minutes. They will still cook in residual heat, so take that in consideration."
- "This method isn&#39;t 100% accurate, so some oil may splatter. Serve with tartare sauce"
- "Tartar Sauce"
