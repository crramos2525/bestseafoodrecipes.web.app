Hello everybody, it's Drew, welcome to my recipe page. Today, I will show you a way to prepare a distinctive dish, grilled &#39;onigiri&#39;. It is one of my favorites. For mine, I am going to make it a little bit unique. This will be really delicious.

Grilled &#39;Onigiri&#39; is one of the most well liked of recent trending meals in the world. It's appreciated by millions every day. It's simple, it's fast, it tastes yummy. They are fine and they look fantastic. Grilled &#39;Onigiri&#39; is something which I've loved my entire life.

Today&#39;s onigiri is grilled, typically on a frying pan or over a barbecue grill. Traditionally, Yaki Onigiri is grilled over charcoal, which lends the rice balls a hint of woodsy, smoky flavor that is truly hard to resist. To make Yaki Onigiri at home, I use a cast iron pan to grill the rice balls instead.


To get started with this recipe, we have to prepare a few components. You can cook grilled &#39;onigiri&#39; using 6 ingredients and 5 steps. Here is how you cook it.

Yaki onigiri, or grilled rice balls, are shaped balls of rice, with or without filling, that are grilled until the rice is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. With this easy recipe you will be able to prepare perfect yaki onigiri for bento lunches, appetisers, or snacks. Onigiri is a classic staple dish in Japan that most Japanese people pack in their bento boxes or buy from the convenience store for lunch. I don&#39;t know why, but Onigiri just tastes so much better than plain rice in a bowl, even though it&#39;s just that very same rice rolled into a triangle shape.
