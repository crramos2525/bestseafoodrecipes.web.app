Fyi (having a licensed paramedical esthetic background with a passion of anything that enhances our natural beauty I&#39;d thought you should know lol) Kale is known for the best leading skin clearing ingredient to date. Please do not substitute with Spinach as this may sound healthy as well but does cause acne. If your not prone to acne, eczema, or psoriasis breakouts then you should be okay with substituting kale for spinach. The combination of kale and parsley is wonderful for improving inflammation of the skin and not to mention tastes wonderful."
