Gluten and Dairy Free Shrimp Scampi Pasta. The combo of tender shrimp, garlic lemon butter sauce and capers were, and still are delicious, but not exactly a great fit for my current dairy and gluten. Pasta may be off the table if you&#39;re cutting carbs, but there are plenty of low carb pasta alternatives! Low carb keto shrimp scampi with zucchini noodles is the perfect example.

Shrimp scampi is usually swimming in butter, this lightened version is just as delicious, using only a touch of butter and lots of fresh lemon. My kids love Pasta and Broccoli , sometimes I make it as a main dish, but also makes a great side dish using any small pasta shape like orzo or ditalini which worked great in this dish. Garlicky white wine sauce and juicy, spicy shrimp coat the spaghetti and a little lemon juice makes the pasta dish sing. So join me in sitting with a big huge bowl of hot delicious Pasta (oh gosh, and maybe a big glass of wine) to fight off the cold!
