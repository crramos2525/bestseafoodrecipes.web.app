- "Pour the mixture into wet glasses, plastic-wrap-lined container or wet jelly moulds, then cool to set. When cool enough, place them in the fridge to set completely."
- "Serve with ‘Wasabi &amp; Soy Sauce’ OR ‘Miso Sauce’ which can be made by mixing 1 tablespoon Miso, 1 tablespoon Mirin and a little bit of Sugar (only if you like it sweeter), or sauce of your choice."
