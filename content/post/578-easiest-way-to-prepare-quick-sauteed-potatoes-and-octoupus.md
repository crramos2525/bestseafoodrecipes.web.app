My husband bought Baby Octopus on a whim and I couldn&#39;t find a recipe that I wanted to try. So, we tried sauteing them in garlic and herbs. These easy sautéed sweet potato fries are a savory and salty alternative to french fries. The sweet potatoes are seasoned while sautéing with a bit of salt, pepper, and garlic powder. They&#39;re perfect just like that, or you can try adding a bit of ginger or curry powder to the recipe for a lightly spicy twist.
