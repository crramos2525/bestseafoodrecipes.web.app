recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 425ยบ"
- "Rinse and dry salmon slice. In a baking pan large enough to hold salmon rub a tiny bit of oil on the bottom of pan. You don&#39;t need a lot. Just a dab is fine it helps to crisp the skin. Place salmon skin side down. If one side is very thin, tuck it under."
- "Squeeze whole grain mustard onto the entire piece of salmon and using the back of a spoon spread evenly adding more mustard if you need so that it covers the entire top of salmon."
- "Sprinkle dill over entire salmon add lemon pepper to your liking."
- "Slice 3 wafer thin pieces of butter (or amount needed for the salmon) make it that the butter is evenly spaced."
- "Baking time depends on the thickness of the salmon. For a slice 3/4&#34; thick bake for 12-13 minutes. For a piece 1 1/2&#34; thick bake 20-22 minutes. The test for doneness is like steak. If you press on it and there is no give, it&#39;s overdone and dry. Salomon is a delicate fish and cooked correctly results in a creamy buttery texture. You can test the thickest part of salmon by gently prying apart. It should be opaque but slightly pinkish."
