- "At last drain the lemons juice, take out the salmon from its bowl and the pieces of onion. Mix the salmon with the onions, add the potatoes dices (these have to be cool enough to not cook our fish we want a steak tartar not a low cooked salmon)and add the dices of avocado. Mix it all together and decorate with agar agar weed and chives, or with what ever you like (mayonnaise, eggs, some more avocado...)"
