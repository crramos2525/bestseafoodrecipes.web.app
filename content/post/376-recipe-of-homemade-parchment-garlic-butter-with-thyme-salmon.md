In a hot oven, melt butter in a skillet until it sizzles, add the salmon, flip, remove the skin, then allow to roast a few minutes more. Don&#39;t be afraid to play with herb and fat combinations: parsley, chervil or dill work well with butter; thyme, basil or marjoram. Basting salmon in a mixture of butter, garlic and thyme make this salmon utterly irresistable. Season salmon generously with salt and pepper.
