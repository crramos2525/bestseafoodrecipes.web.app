- "1/2-3/4 lb skinless salmon fillet 2 large filets"
- "1 1/2 limes divided"
- "1 chipotle peppers canned in adobo seeded and finely chopped"
- "1 tbsp adobo sauce from the chipotle can"
- "1 tsp pure maple syrup"
- "2 cloves garlic thinly sliced"

- "1/4 cup cilantro leaves"
- " Juice of  lime"
- "1 pinch kosher salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "Prep time!"
- "Rinse the salmon filets under cold water and gently pat them dry with paper towels. Place the fish in a large Ziploc bag."
- "In a small bowl, combine the juice of 1 lime, the chipotle pepper, adobo sauce, maple syrup, and sliced garlic. Pour the mixture into the bag with the salmon. Seal the bag, removing as much air as possible, and gently squish the fish around to coat with marinade. Marinate for 30 minutes at room temperature, turning the bag over once halfway through."
- "Meanwhile, place the sliced Brussels sprouts in a mixing bowl. Add the juice of the remaining ½ lime, and a good pinch of salt and fresh ground pepper. Toss to combine. Briefly set aside."
- "Make your salsa. Combine all the ingredients for the salsa and toss to combine. (If you’re into spice, leave a few seeds in your jalapeño.) Refrigerate until ready to use."
- "Pre-heat a lightly oiled grill (pan) over medium-high heat. When hot, add the salmon and cook for about 4 minutes per side until cooked through and lightly charred on the outside. Transfer salmon to a cutting board and flake with a fork. (I like to leave some larger chunks.)"
- "Warm the tortillas. You can do this in your microwave, or throw each tortilla directly on your burner for a few seconds per side."
- "Time to assemble your tacos. Add a little salmon to each tortilla, and top with a generous amount of sprouts and salsa. Finish with a sprinkling of goat cheese. Serve with lime wedges if you like."
- "Enjoy!"
