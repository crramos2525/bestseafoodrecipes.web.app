- "When the pancake is cooked, spread the combined okonomiyaki and takoyaki sauces, fold in half and press."
- "If you add too much squid, the pancakes will be hard to cook. I&#39;m not too good at cooking these myself. If you&#39;re not used to making  pancakes, try cooking one with just a little squid added to the batter."
