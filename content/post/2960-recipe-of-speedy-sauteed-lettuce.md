Lettuce adds a fresh, earthy flavor and texture to the beef, chicken, pork or vegetarian, stir-fries you normally cook. Add the lettuce to the pan near the end of cooking, as the last ingredient, at the same time you add any sauce to the pan. Yes, we all know that lettuce is the foundation of most salads, but c&#39;mon — lettuce has so much more to give! I love that you don&#39;t have to use up a whole head at once — one head in the crisper drawer can be used in so many different ways over the course of days, so you won&#39;t ever feel like you&#39;re eating the same thing over and over again.
