- "Heat up the milk. Reserve 1/4 cup of the milk and mix cornstarch in it. Set aside."
- "In a clean pan, add the sugar and water and bring it to a gentle boil. Let the mixture keep boiling for 5-6 minutes. You’ll start to see that it starts turning a deep brown colour. DO NOT STIR. Just let the mixture cook on medium-low heat."

- "Pass the mixture through a sieve to get a smooth, lump-free mixture."
- "Add the cooled mixture to the previously whipped cream. Gently fold the mixture into the cream."
- "Divide the mixture equally between serving glasses. Cover and chill in the refrigerator until it has set. (It could take about 3-4 hours)"
- "Garnish with chocolate chips or butterscotch chips, or chopped nuts &amp; serve."
