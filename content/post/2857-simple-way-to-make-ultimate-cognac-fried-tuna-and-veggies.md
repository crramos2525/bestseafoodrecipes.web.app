Ramen and canned tuna were some of the cheapest foods I could get my hands on (especially because they could be mailed!). Drain the ramen and veggies and add them to the frying pan with the tuna and continue to cook until the noodles become slightly sticky. Take the veggies out of the oven after flipping the tuna and plate the veggies. When the tuna is done, put them on top of the veggies right away so they don&#39;t overcook. You can use whatever ingredients you find in your refrigerator and it&#39;s sure to delight you and everyone at the table.
