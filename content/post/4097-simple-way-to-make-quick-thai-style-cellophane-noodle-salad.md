- "Combine the cellophane noodles, cucumber, lettuce and stir fried ingredients from Step 7 into a bowl, add the ☆ ingredients and mix well."
- "Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper, transfer to serving plates and it&#39;s done! It&#39;s also good if you chill in the refrigerator for a while. It tastes even better the next day when the flavors have melded together."
- "If you add cilantro or celery, or sprinkle chopped peanuts at the end, it will taste even more authentic."
