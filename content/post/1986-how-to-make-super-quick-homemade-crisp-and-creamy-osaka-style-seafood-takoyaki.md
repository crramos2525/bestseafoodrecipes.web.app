We bought fresh octopus from the Sydney seafood market. Sprinkle on the aonori, green seaweed, hanakatsuo, dried bonito flakes and lots of spring onion leaves. They&#39;re crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and the batter has a nice taste of ginger that distinguishes these takoyaki from others. The restaurant is located near the Tenjinbashisuji Rokuchome station.
