recipeinstructions:
- "Slice the onion thinly. Divide the king oyster mushrooms into 2-3 sections and slice into thin sticks. Divide the buna shimeji mushrooms into small clusters. Cut the Chinese cabbage into 1-2 cm pieces."
- "Wash the spinach, blanch it briefly and then cool in cold water. Squeeze it out lightly, and cut into 3 cm pieces."
- "Sprinkle the salmon with a little salt and pepper to pre-season it, then dust with katakuriko. (You could cut the salmon into easy to eat pieces)."
- "Put some oil in a deep non-stick frying pan (or use more oil if using a regular, not-non-stick frying pan) and line the bottom with the salmon. Cover with a lid and steam-fry."
- "If the heat is too strong, the salmon will burn before it&#39;s cooked through, so watch the heat level."
- "When the salmon is browned on the surface, turn it over and cook in the same way with the lid on on the other side. Take the salmon out of the frying pan, and cook the vegetables and mushrooms in the same pan."
- "Put in the onion, king oyster and buna shimeji mushrooms and the Chinese cabbage and stir fry quickly. Put the lid back on and steam-cook over low heat. Be careful not to let it burn."
- "If you are using a regular frying pan that&#39;s not non-stick, you may need to add a bit more oil."
- "When everything has softened up and the ingredients start to release their moisture, add the soy milk and soup stock. Put the salmon back in and simmer a little over low-medium heat."
- "If the vegetables and mushrooms don&#39;t exude much moisture, add a bit more soy milk."
- "When the soy milk has warmed through and the surface is bubbling a little, add the spinach, taste and adjust the seasoning with salt to finish."
- "Once you add the soy milk, adjust the heat so that it doesn&#39;t boil up. If it does boil the soy milk will coagulate and separate and the sauce won&#39;t look nice."
- "If the sauce is not creamy enough, thicken by adding katakuriko dissolved in water."
