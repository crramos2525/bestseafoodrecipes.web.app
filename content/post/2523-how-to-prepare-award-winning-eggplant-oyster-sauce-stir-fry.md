Eggplant Stir Fry. written by Emma Tang. After frying the eggplants until they are cooked through and soft, I simply stir-fried the eggplants together with the rest of the ingredients as well as the half a tablespoon oyster sauce. This savory eggplant stir-fry makes a great main course when served over rice and topped with fresh cilantro (if you like it). In a small bowl, whisk together the hoisin sauce, soy sauce, sesame oil and rice vinegar.
