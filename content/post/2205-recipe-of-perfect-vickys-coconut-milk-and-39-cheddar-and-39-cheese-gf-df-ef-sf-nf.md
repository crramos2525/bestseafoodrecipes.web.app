recipeingredient:
- "2 can full fat coconut milk total amount 800mls"
- "3 tbsp agar flakes or 3 tsp agar powder or as required"
- "1/2 tsp cider vinegar or white balsamic"
- "4 tbsp tapioca starch or corn starchcornflour"
- "1 tsp smoked paprika"
- "2 tsp sea salt"
- "15 grams (1/4 cup) nutritional yeast flakes"
recipeinstructions:
- "Boil the coconut milk until it&#39;s no longer separated. Add the vinegar, agar flakes and salt. Boil gently for 15 minutes (no need to boil 15 minutes if using agar agar powder)"
- "Add the remaining ingredients one at a time, whisking continuously. Cook for another 5 - 10 minutes"
- "Take off the heat and scrape into a greased glass bowl or parchment paper lined small loaf tin"
- "Let cool two hours, it will set at room temperature. If you put in the fridge overnight you can slice and grate it. It&#39;s a little slippery though for grating and easier to just slice. If you can&#39;t wait to try it spread it on a cracker now lol"
- "Use sliced in sandwiches, top pizzas, melt for mac &amp; cheese or use as a quesadilla filler!"
- "Will make a block the same size as a 300g block of normal cheese but doesn&#39;t weigh that much!"
- "The vinegar stops the agar setting so solid that you can&#39;t slice it. If you find it sets too hard, increase the vinegar by a half tsp. Likewise if it&#39;s too gellatinous, reduce the vinegar to a quarter tsp. I&#39;ve only tried these 2 kinds of vinegar so I don&#39;t know if other varieties make a difference to set or flavour. Different brands of agar also state different setting amounrs on the packets. I use Clearspring brand"
