recipeinstructions:
- "Bring a large pot of water to boil. Do not cook the noodle yet."

- "Add pork and cook for 5 min with high heat. You don’t want to move the meat too much to get the crispiness"
- "(This time, we used already flavored meat but if you are using non-flavored meat, you can flavor with salt, pepper, red chili pepper and ginger power before you sauté)"
- "Add root side chinese chives then stir until chives are soft, 1 minute."
- "Add kimchi and sauté for 3 minutes."
- "Turn off the heat then add leaf side chinese chives and bean sprouts then stir them well. (They will be cooked with left over heat)"
- "Now you can cook noodles, don’t over cook it. Set the timer for one minute shorter for Al dente. This time we used these noodles but you can use anything you like."
- "Decorate them pretty and enjoy!"
