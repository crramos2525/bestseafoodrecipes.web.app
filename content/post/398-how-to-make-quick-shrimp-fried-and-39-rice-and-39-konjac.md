recipeingredient:
- "250 g drained konjac rice"
- "1 medium egg beaten"
- "100 g small frozen shrimp"
- "3 finely chopped spring onions"
- "20 g petit pois peas"
- "A few drops of dark soy sauce"
- "1/2 tbsp light soy sauce"
- "1 good pinch of salt"
- " Vegetable oil for frying"
recipeinstructions:
- "Boil the drained konjac rice in salted water for 5 minutes then drain it off and set aside. I find this gives it a better texture and removes any smell from the liquid it&#39;s stored in, which can smell a bit fishy."
- "Heat up a wok over a high heat then add in the prawns. Cook until the water is released, then drain it off. Add in the peas and stir fry for 2 minutes. Remove from the wok into a small bowl and set aside. Add in the beaten egg and cook until you have small clumps then place them into the bowl with the shrimp and peas."
- "Add in 1/2 tbsp oil to the wok and heat. Add the egg, prawns and peas back in followed by the spring onion. Fry for a minute then add the drained konjac rice. Toss everything together. Season with a good pinch of salt, a few drops of dark soy and the light soy sauce. Stir everything together until every strand is evenly coated in the soy."
- "Serve up and enjoy! :)"
