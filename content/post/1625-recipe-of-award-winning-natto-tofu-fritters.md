recipeinstructions:
- "Mix all the ingredients together in a bowl (if the natto came with a sauce packet, put that in too)."
- "Heat oil in a frying pan, and drop spoonfuls of the mixture into the pan."
- "When each side has been fried to a golden brown color, they are done! They&#39;re good on their own, or dipped into ponzu sauce."
- "If you add ground meat, they will become natto tofu burgers. I think they&#39;d be good with cheese, although that would increase the calories."

- "I tried it with ginger in the mix as well as on top. Ginger stimulates your digestion."
