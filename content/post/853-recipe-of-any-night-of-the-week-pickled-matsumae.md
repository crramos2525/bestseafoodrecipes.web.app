- "1 small Carrot"
- "6 small pieces Herring roe"
- "133 ml Sake"
- "133 ml Mirin"
- "133 ml Soy sauce"

recipeinstructions:
- "Use three times the amount of water for every 100 g of herring row with a small teaspoon of salt (not listed), and let soak for 2 hours changing the water 5-6 times. Lastly, peel the membrane from the roe."
- "Lightly pat dry both sides of the dried squid with a rag that has been thoroughly rung out. (Cheap paper towels will leave behind lint, so they&#39;re no good)."
- "Cut off the legs, and cut off the hard parts from the trunk (you won&#39;t use them)."
- "Cut it up as finely as you possibly can with a pair of scissors as it&#39;ll expand later when cooking. If the squid is too tough, sprinkle with sake or soak completely to soften. Keep the leftover sake for later as we&#39;ll use it later."
- "Lightly wipe the konbu seaweed with a rag, sprinkle with sake to soften, and julienne. If the konbu is too soft, it will be difficult to cut, so be careful."
- "Finely chop the carrots as well."
- "Add the • ingredients to a small saucepan, and bring to a boil."
- "Wipe the water from the desalted herring roe, and cut into pieces."
- "Place the squid cut into thin strips, the konbu, the carrots, and herring roe into a bowl along with the cooled Step 7, and mix."
- "Let sit in the fridge, stirring it around from time to time (if you keep nibbling at it to test the flavor, it&#39;ll be gone before you know it). After it has softened and turned an amber color and the konbu has turned sticky, it&#39;s done."
- "I garnished the dish with julienned yuzu peel for aroma."
- "It is best to eat it within 5 days to 1 week."
