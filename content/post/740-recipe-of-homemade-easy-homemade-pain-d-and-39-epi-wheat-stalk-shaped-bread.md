- "When the dough has proofed, snip the dough quite deeply and at a sharp angle with kitchen scissors, then push the cut parts to the left and right alternately (it&#39;s fun!). Preheat the oven to 250℃."
- "Mist the dough with a water sprayer about 10 times, and bake in the oven for 15-20 minutes at 220℃."
- "After baking, cool them a little. Freshly baked Pain d&#39;Epi is the best!"
