Spoon the marinated tuna into the cucumber &#34;cups&#34;. This Tuna salad with Avocado and Cucumbers is a modern twist on an American classic. Put the avocado tuna salad between two pieces of toast and you have a rather perfect tuna salad sandwich with the lovely addition of avocado and without any mayonnaise. To be clear, I don&#39;t have any problem with mayo. But I am rather passionate about avocados so given the opportunity to sub one.
