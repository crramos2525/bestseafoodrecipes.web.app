recipeingredient:
- "400 gr fresh bamboo shoots"
- "150 gr beef tenderloin"
- "1 small knob ginger pounded"
- "1 shallot thinly sliced"
- "1/2 head garlic minced"
- " Scallions and cilantro finely chopped"
- " Sugar oyster sauce spices cooking oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Rinse beef and pat dry, thinly slice. Marinate beef with ginger, 1 tablespoon of cooking oil, 1 tablespoon of oyster sauce, 1 teaspoon of soup base in 20-30 minutes. Strip bamboo shoots lengthwise, rinse many times under cold water. Gently squeeze bamboo to remove water. Put a pot of water over the heat. When water boils, add bamboo shoots and 1.5 teaspoon of sugar into the pot (sugar helps to remove the smell of bamboo). Cook until the bamboo boils again in about 3 minutes then turn off the heat (please remember to boil with no lid on). Wash the bamboo again with cold water. Pour the bamboo into a colander to let water drain off."
- "Put a skillet on the stove, heat 1 tablespoon of cooking oil then add garlic to fry until fragrant. Use high heat, pour beef into the skillet to stir-fry in about 2-3 minutes until it becomes a bit shriveled. Beef at this stage can be fairly rare but when stir-fried with bamboo, it will no longer be chewy. Transfer beef to a plate."
- "Put the skillet back on the stove, heat 1 tablespoon of cooking oil then fry shallots until fragrant. Fry over high heat, add bamboo shoots and liquid from stir-frying beef, stir-fry in about 3-4 minutes. Pour beef into the skillet to stir-fry until fully cooked. Add spices to taste if needed at this step. Add scallions, cilantro and toss in about 10 seconds then turn off the heat. Served hot, very &#34;rice-consuming&#34;. Good luck^^"
