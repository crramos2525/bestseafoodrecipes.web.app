- "After dough has rested set your pasta machine to the thickest setting and begin putting your dough through, gradually lowering the settings to achieve a thin sheet of pasta.

- "Remove from the heat and take the mussels out, strain liquid and reserve for later. Remove mussel meat from the shell, chop and set aside."
- "To Assemble:"
- "Bring a large pot of water to the boil."
- "Warm a pan and add the extra virgin oil, do not heat to smoking point. Lightly poach cuttlefish and prawns in oil then quickly add garlic and chilli, cook for a further minute and remove seafood and oil to awaiting bowl. Return pan to heat and turn up gas, add about 80ml of mussel stock and begin to put pasta in the boiling water one at a time stirring when you finish."
- "Cook pasta for one minute then remove and add to the pan, (you may need to add a little of the pasta water if your stock has reduced to far) add seafood and oil mix and begin to emulsify the oil and stock by tossing the pasta in the pan, check your seasoning and finish with chopped chervil, plate and serve."
