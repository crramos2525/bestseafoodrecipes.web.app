- "Arrange them just before eating them. Top with capers to finish. Just one caper per piece made them look like shumai dumplings to me, so I put on 2 per piece."

##### Steps to make Festive Salmon Temari Sushi:

1. I used this thinly sliced salmon this time.
1. Make the sushi vinegar: Put the vinegar, sugar and salt in a small pan, and warm up while stirring to dissolve the sugar. (This one is brown because I used 100% rice vinegar.)
1. Put the freshly cooked hot rice in a bowl or similar, and swirl on the sushi vinegar.
1. Cut and fold to mix with a rice paddle, taking care not to mash the rice grains.
1. When the sushi vinegar is evenly mixed in, and there are no lumps of rice, fan it to cool it down. This will make the sushi rice very shiny.
1. Spread out a piece of plastic wrap on a scale, and place the sashimi on top. Since the sashimi I used this time was very thin I used 2 slices. If you have thicker slices of sashimi, 1 is fine.
1. Set the scale to 0 (use the TARE function if you&#39;re using a digital scale) and put on 50 g of sushi rice. The rice sticks to the spoon, so dip the spoon in water each time. Add wasabi if you like.
1. Twist the wrap tightly, and form a nice round ball. Keep the sushi wrapped in plastic to prevent it from drying out until it&#39;s time to serve them.
1. Arrange them just before eating them. Top with capers to finish. Just one caper per piece made them look like shumai dumplings to me, so I put on 2 per piece.
1. You can also form the sushi by putting a caper on the plastic wrap, then the sashimi, followed by the rice.
