This prawn and mango curry is best served with a generous helping of fluffy rice and some warm naan bread. Ever since my visit to the Groves Grown Tropical Fruit farm which I babbled about in the Coconut Shrimp/Prawns with Spicy Thai Mango Sauce recipe I shared a couple. Raw mangoes impart a light tangy flavor to the curry dish while coconut milk imparts a creamy texture to the dish. Prawns are very nutritious, rich in protein and other vital nutrients.
