This Prawns Curry is a very simple recipe of prawns cooked in an onion-tomato gravy. However, sometimes when I am too bored to scrap the coconut or want to make some curry quickly, this prawns curry recipe without coconut acts as the savior. I set straight out to research how to make Thai Panang Curry and decided to use Prawns (aka shrimp) &#39;cause … well … just &#39;cause. So this Penang Curry is sweet, rich and creamy. Traditionally it is made with coconut cream rather than coconut milk resulting in a thicker sauce that is just meant to coat the.
