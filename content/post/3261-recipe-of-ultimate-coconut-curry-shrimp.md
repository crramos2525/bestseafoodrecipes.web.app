recipeinstructions:
- "Melt butter in preheated skillet. Add onion and garlic. Saut√© on low heat until soft and fragrant. Add a few good dashes of curry powder, black pepper, red pepper flakes (if you want it spicy) and a pinch of salt. Keep on low for another couple minutes. It&#39;ll start getting a bit pastey."
- "Add half the can of coconut milk, continuing to saut√© on low heat until it bubbles immediately after stirring. Add the rest of the coconut milk and the water till it&#39;s bubbly again. Add more curry powder and a squeeze of lime juice."
- "Once the curry sauce is hot, add the raw shrimp. Continue simmering on low heat, stirring about every 3-5 minutes. Add more spice throughout according to your preference. Let it slowly simmer, stirring regularly for probably 20-30 minutes. Add the cilantro in the last 5 minutes of cooking. Serve over rice."

As always I encourage using your own creativity. Add other Indian spices or substitutions if something strikes your fancy. I&#39;ve seen a lot of recipes call for fresh basil instead of the cilantro, for example. Cilantro sounded better to me üòÅ Enjoy and have fun!"
