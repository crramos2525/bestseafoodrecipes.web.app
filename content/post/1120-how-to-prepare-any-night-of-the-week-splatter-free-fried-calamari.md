- "Instead of adding in all the flour at once, use your judgement to add more as necessary."
- "Coat the squid entirely with panko so that the water content from the squid won&#39;t leak."
- "Heat 2-3 cm of oil in a frying pan. Then drop the squid rings into the oil and fry. Be sure to have the heat on medium!"
- "If you don&#39;t have enough oil, it becomes difficult to cook the squid because the temperature will fluctuate. Use a generous amount of oil."
- "If you cook them for too long, they will be hard on the inside. I recommend cooking for about 1-1.5 minutes. They will still cook in residual heat, so take that in consideration."
