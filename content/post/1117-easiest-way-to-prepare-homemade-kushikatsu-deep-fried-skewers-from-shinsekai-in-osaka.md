- "Next make the batter. Beat the egg, and combine with the milk and water. Add the flour to this and mix well. When there are no more lumps, add the grated yamaimo."

- "Cut each chikuwa into 5 pieces and stuff with cheese. Skewer 2 pieces at a time."

- "Dip the skewers in the batter. Shake off any excess batter, then coat the skewers in the panko. Once you have breaded about 10 skewers, start frying."
- "Fry them quickly in 170°C oil. The vegetable skewers take about a minute, and the meat skewers take about 2 minutes to cook."
- "When the skewers are golden brown and crispy, drain off the oil very well and put the skewers on a rack. When the oil has drained off completely transfer the skewers to a serving plate."
- "Scoop out any panko left in the oil after each batch is fried. The panko are very fine, so use a tea strainer to remove them until the oil is clean."
- "Dip the skewers completely in the special sauce. Dip the cut cabbage that&#39;s served with the skewers in the sauce too! Beer is the drink to serve with this!"
- "Today I fried quail eggs, cherry tomatoes, lotus root, shrimp, chikuwa stuffed with cheese, beef round, thinly sliced pork, okra, eggplant, chicken thigh meat, and asparagus."
- "These are authentic kushikatsu from a famous restaurant in Shinsekai. They were amazingly yummy!"
