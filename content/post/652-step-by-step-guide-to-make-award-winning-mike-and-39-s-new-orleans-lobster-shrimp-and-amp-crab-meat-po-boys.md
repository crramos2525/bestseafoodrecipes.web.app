You&#39;re watching: New Orleans-Style Barbequed Shrimp. This video shows you how to make flavorful New Orleans-style, grill-free barbequed shrimp. We&#39;re talking big, big flavors all around here, in the shrimp marinade, the shrimp stock (which you&#39;ll see how to prepare using the shrimp shells). flickr/Michael Daddino.
