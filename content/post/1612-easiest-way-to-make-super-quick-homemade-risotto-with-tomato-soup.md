The butter in this dish can however be replaced with olive oil to make it healthier. A Tomato-Rich Risotto That&#39;s Hearty and Special. This risotto recipe stands out from others because in addition to the usual chicken broth that&#39;s used as the cooking liquid, a can of diced tomatoes and their juices join in. That means the rice absorbs that tangy. Risotto the dish is really more of a cross between rice and pasta, and equally delightful as a side dish next to chicken, beef, or fish‚Ä¶or as a main course I want to amplify the tomato-cream component.
