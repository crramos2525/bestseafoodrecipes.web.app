Cook all vegetales for 30 minutes in the Oven at 230 degrees Celsius."

- "When the vegetables in the oven are done, transfer all vegetables to the quinoa and mix. Set aside to cool."
- "While the oven is still hot from the vegetables, Place your salmon on your oven tray and prep salmon on there adding a sprinkle of salt and pepper on top. Also with another oven tray (preferably the tray with grill tray) place the pepper on top. Place the tray with the pepper to the highest rack and the salmon on to the middle rack. Cook for 12-15 at 210 degrees Celsius."
