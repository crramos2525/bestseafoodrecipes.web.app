In separate bowl, blend panko crumbs with Parmesan cheese (more mixture may be needed for breading). The flaky, supple meat adds a delicately sweet richness to everything from soups and salads to dips and crostini. Of course, crab meat is arguably showcased at its best when formed into a classic crab cake. Crab has always been my favorite type of shellfish, but I have never really cared much for crab cakes. The overpowering presence of seasoned breadcrumbs used in most recipes interferes with the sweet and delicate flavors of the fresh lump crabmeat.
