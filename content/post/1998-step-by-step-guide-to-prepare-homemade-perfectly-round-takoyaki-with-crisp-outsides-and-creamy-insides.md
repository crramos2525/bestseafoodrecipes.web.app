##### The ingredients needed to make Perfectly Round Takoyaki With Crisp Outsides and Creamy Insides:

1. Make ready 4 tentacles Octopus (sashimi grade)
1. Prepare 400 ml ▲ Cake flour
1. Make ready 2 tbsp ▲ Dashi soup stock (I recommend regular dashi stock or chicken soup stock. I use dashida.)

Don&#39;t worry though.there are no chunks of octopus in this yummy snack. Count on Frito Lay Japan for new and unique products. The problem is that normally, you would require a special takoyaki pan and some pretty impressive ninja skills to make takoyaki. I found a foolproof workaround using ice cube trays.

To achieve such consistent roasting results, all you need to do is introduce one new element to your typical process—a little bit of water.
