recipeinstructions:

- "Cut the cabbage into half, then chop into about 4 cm pieces. Slice the shiitake mushrooms diagonally into strips. Cut off the shimeji mushroom stems and shred."
- "In a frying pan, add about half a tablespoon of oil and minced garlic and ginger, and  sauté well over medium to low heat. Once it starts to brown, add the gochujang paste and stir together."
- "Add the pork. Turn up the heat and once the coloring starts to change, add the onion slices and cook through. It&#39;s done once you add kimchi and stir them well together."
- "Transfer the stir-fried pork and kimchi from step 4 into a clay pot moistened with water. In the frying pan used for stir-frying, add the ◎ ingredients (without having washed the pan) and bring to a boil. Once the soup is ready, pour it into the clay pot."

- "Note I think it depends on the quality (material) of the clay pot and how you adjust the heat, but there may be a case in which it burns a little."
- "I didn&#39;t want to stir-fry in a clay pot, so I used a frying pan. If you&#39;re using a pot other than a clay pot, it&#39;s easy to make if you place the other ingredients over the stir-fry from step 4 and pour soup over it."
- "Since the pork is flavored well and cooked through, it won&#39;t turn into wasted ground pieces but will stay delicious to be eaten."
