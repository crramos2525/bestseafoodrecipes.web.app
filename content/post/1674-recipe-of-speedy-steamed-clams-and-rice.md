My name is Corrie Cooks and I am here to help! Clams are usually something you eat at your favorite restaurant or on holiday at a seaside resort, but you can also easily cook them at home, especially with the help of your Instant Pot. Steamed clams is a seafood dish consisting of clams cooked by steaming. In the United States, steamed clams are usually made with small soft-shell clams (Mya arenaria) called steamers, and sometimes with other shellfish harvested and served along the East Coast and in New England. Steamed Clams might be one of my favorite dishes to serve during the summer when the sun is out, everyone is excited to be outside and you want a light meal.
