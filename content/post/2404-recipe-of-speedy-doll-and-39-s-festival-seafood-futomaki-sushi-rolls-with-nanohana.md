- "Lay the delicate broccolini, shrimp, and imitation crab in the center. Lay the tuna and tamagoyaki on top."
- "Use the front end of the rice to wrap up the ingredients, and roll up after squeezing tightly."
- "You will get a cleaner cut if the rice and ingredients are tightly packed together, so let it sit for a while wrapped in the sushi mat."
- "When cutting, cut the rolls by moving the knife back and forth in a sawing motion, and wipe the blade with a wet cloth between each cut."
