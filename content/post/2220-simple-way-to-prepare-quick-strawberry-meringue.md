##### Instructions to make Strawberry Meringue:

1. Prepare the strawberries and cut them in half or quarters depending on how big the strawberries are.
1. In a bowl whip the double cream until it becomes stiff.
1. Add the whipped cream to the top of the shells.

In a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat the egg whites, cream of. Remove from oven; cool completely on baking sheets. Dip bottoms in melted chocolate; allow excess to drip off. But this is NOT the strawberry meringue buttercream frosting recipe in Stewart&#39;s Cupcakes book. The book uses fresh, pureed strawberries, which when added to the egg whites &amp; sugar turn it into a pink soup that can not be saved.
