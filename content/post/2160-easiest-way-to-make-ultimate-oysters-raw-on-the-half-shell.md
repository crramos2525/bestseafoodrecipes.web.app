recipeinstructions:
- "Strike oyster shells using the blunt side of a butcher knife. Be sure to strike the opening seam while holding the oyster in the vertical position."
- "A few strikes will render the shell slightly ajar, insert the sharp side of the blade (not the point) and pry open to a 45° angle."
- "Use the point of your knife to separate the foot of the oyster from its shell on both sides. Use your hands to open the shell completely; discard the more shallow half of the shell."

- "Slice the lemons in half and serve on the side along with all remaining ingredients. The oysters can be enjoyed with any combination of the condiments; my personal favorite is a light squeeze of lemon juice, a pinch of salt and a dash of Tobasco sauce."
- "Advise your guests to NOT chew the oysters, they are to be savored and swallowed whole."
