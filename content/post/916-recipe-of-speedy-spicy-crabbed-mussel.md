Stir briefly and add the crab meat and mussels. We didn&#39;t care for the cod fish so when I make it again I&#39;ll leave that out and use all mussels, shrimp and crab. Scrub the mussels in a large bowl of cold water and discard any that are open. Put in a large pan with the wine. Tip the mussels into a colander set over a large bowl to catch the juices.
