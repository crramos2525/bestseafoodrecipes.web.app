My favourite thing about this soup stock is that it is easy to make and it lets you squeeze every little bit of nutrition out of your vegetables and has absolutely unexpected ingredients like store bought soup stock can. The ONLY tricky thing about this stock, is remembering to put aside your scrap veggies. This tasty homemade vegetable soup recipe with a tomato base features potatoes, green beans, and carrots for a quick and easy meal. A low calorie, but filling, tomato-based vegetable soup. I use fresh vegetables when in season, frozen or canned in winter.
