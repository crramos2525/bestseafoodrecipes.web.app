This Alfredo Zoodles recipe combines so many of my favorite things! The zoodles are coated with a lighter alfredo sauce, the shrimp are sauteed in a little bit of butter, and it&#39;s all finished off with some cooked bacon too. I make my alfredo sauce with the extra ingredient of cream as it creates a thicker, creamier sauce. I added smoked bacon, mushrooms and chives, but this would also be great with chicken and a different herb such as parsley.

While cooking bowtie pasta by package instructions, combine Alfredo sauce, soup, milk, mushrooms and shrimp and heat at medim temp until shrimp are cooked. Drain pasta, pour sauce over pasta.
