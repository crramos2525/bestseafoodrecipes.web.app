I don&#39;t think this dish is any easier than boiling pasta in one pot, and making a quick tomato sauce in another, besides one less pot to. I marinated the shrimp in olive oil, garlic, and fresh basil for a few hours while I simmered a simple and spicy basil marinara. I served the sauce over whole wheat penned then topped the dish with pan grilled shrimp. This seafood pasta is a mix of shrimp, clams, mussels and scallops, all tossed together with spaghetti in a homemade tomato sauce. Whenever I go to my local Italian restaurant, I order their special mixed seafood pasta.
