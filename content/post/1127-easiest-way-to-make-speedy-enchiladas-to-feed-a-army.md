Use the Improved Iron Trap to capture a Boar or Riverbeast in Gorgrond and then place a Work Order at your Barn. We&#39;ve had a chance to work with these beasts for a while now. Feeding Frenzy and Death Mark don&#39;t work fully either (former applies Aggressive, but not the damage buff, latter applies only the non-marked damage and the focusing is awkward). No Melee Splash, which is one of the biggest issues besides the spectres only doing good damage if you&#39;re an aurabot. Goodreads helps you keep track of books you want to read.
