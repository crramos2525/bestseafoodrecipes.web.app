Octopus is a tasty, healthy, lean seafood that can sometimes be tough when cooked. By tenderizing the meat before cooking and then cooking the octopus in its own juices, you can break down the tough muscle fibers and preserve the juiciness of the meat, resulting in a moist and tender meal that isn&#39;t.
