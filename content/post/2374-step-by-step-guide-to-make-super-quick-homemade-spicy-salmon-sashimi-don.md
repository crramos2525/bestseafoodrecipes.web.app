This easy Spicy Salmon Poke is a festival of textures and tastes in every bite. With big cubes of salmon It&#39;s not as cut and dry as looking for labels such as &#34;sushi-quality&#34; or &#34;sashimi-grade&#34; If you don&#39;t have a coarse salt, be sure to reduce the amount you add, or your Poke will end up too salty. Serve this Spicy Salmon (Faux-kay) Poke on cucumber slices for an elegant hors d&#39;oeuvre, or spoon them into little squares of seaweed snacks to make poke I discovered Hawaiian poke (pronounced POH-kay) the first time we visited the paradise island. Traditional poke is essentially a sashimi salad. What happens when you hoard pickled ginger and there&#39;s sashimi grade salmon available at the market…Spicy Salmon Sushi Bowls!!
