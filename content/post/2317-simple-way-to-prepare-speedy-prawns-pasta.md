Grate the zest of the lemon and roughly chop the rocket. When the pasta is ready, drain it in a colander, reserving a little of the cooking water. First put the frozen prawns in a bowl and cover with warm water to defrost them. I always add a few drops of olive oil to the pasta when I am boiling it. When the pasta is ready, remove and drain in the sieve.
