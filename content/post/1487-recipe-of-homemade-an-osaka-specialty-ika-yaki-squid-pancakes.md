recipeinstructions:

- "Combine the flours, dashi stock granules, and water, and mix until it&#39;s slightly sticky (meaning the gluten in the flour has formed)."
- "Add the squid to the batter, and leave for at least 30 minutes. If the batter becomes too firm, add a little water so that it&#39;s the consistency of crepe batter."
- "Add oil in a pan, and pour in the batter (You can add an egg here to upgrade the pancake to a deluxe version.)"

- "When the pancake is cooked, spread the combined okonomiyaki and takoyaki sauces, fold in half and press."
- "If you add too much squid, the pancakes will be hard to cook. I&#39;m not too good at cooking these myself. If you&#39;re not used to making  pancakes, try cooking one with just a little squid added to the batter."
