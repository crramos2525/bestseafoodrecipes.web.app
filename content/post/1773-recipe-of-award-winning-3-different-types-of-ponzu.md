- "This flavored ponzu sauce is mild and goes with  all kinds of food. When using it as a dipping sauce for hot pots, squeeze in a little citrus juice from any citrus in season, and it will smell wonderful."

- "Squeeze the citrus juice of your choice, strain out the seeds and pulp, and pour it slowly into the bowl."
