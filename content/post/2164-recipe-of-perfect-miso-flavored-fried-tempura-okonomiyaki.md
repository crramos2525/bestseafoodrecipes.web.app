recipeinstructions:

- "Add 1 cm squared cabbage, sakura shrimp, red pickled ginger, any of your favorite ingredients, and a cracked egg to the bowl from Step 1. Gently mix it up with a fork or cooking chopsticks."
- "Heat oil in a pan, and cook over medium heat. Once the sides have hardened, flip over. Press down firmly on it with a spatula, and lightly coat the top with half of the miso."

- "Flip it over again, and it is done once you fry the miso. You cook it through on both sides, coat with miso, and fry it again over low heat."
- "Garnish the fried okonomiyaki with scallions. Top with mayonnaise if you like.  However, please first try a bite with just the simple taste of miso."
- "Variation: Add 1/2 teaspoon of curry powder roux for faint flavor of curry. It goes better with the sauce. I recommend making it with green onions and corn."
