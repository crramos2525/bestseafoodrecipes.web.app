In our Thai basil beef recipe, sambal stands in for fresh chilis—scooping some chili paste out of a jar is a lot easier than messing around with fresh chilis. Basil—using Thai holy basil (if you&#39;re lucky enough to find it) makes this spicy beef stir-fry worthy of the name &#34;phat ka-phrao&#34; which means &#34;holy. Chef John&#39;s version of this classic Thai dish, made with freshly chopped chicken thighs and fresh basil, has a rich sauce that cooks down into a caramelized glaze.
