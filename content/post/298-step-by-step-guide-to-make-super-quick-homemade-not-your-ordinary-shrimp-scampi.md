SHRIMP scampi is a dish so entrenched in the Italian-American vernacular that until the day I decided to make it, I did not realize that I didn&#39;t know what it was. Flipping through an old-school Italian cookbook complete. The crusty Italian bread is a perfect complement I did cut down on the red pepper flakes. I used a little Asian chili sauce in addition to the red pepper flakes and served it over homemade noodles. Making shrimp scampi is all about speed: you do not want to step away from the stove and risk over-cooking your shrimp.
