- "Microwave the ● ingredients, mix together thoroughly, and let cool. If you don&#39;t have dashi broth, just add a little bit of dashi stock granules to water."
- "Coat a pan with oil (not listed), and make a tamagoyaki. Wrap up in a bamboo sushi mat to let it cool and shape it. The tamagoyaki won&#39;t cook through if you cook it in low heat, so be careful."

- "Lay the delicate broccolini, shrimp, and imitation crab in the center. Lay the tuna and tamagoyaki on top."
- "Use the front end of the rice to wrap up the ingredients, and roll up after squeezing tightly."
- "You will get a cleaner cut if the rice and ingredients are tightly packed together, so let it sit for a while wrapped in the sushi mat."
- "When cutting, cut the rolls by moving the knife back and forth in a sawing motion, and wipe the blade with a wet cloth between each cut."
