- " big size King oyster mushrooms"
- " Thinly sliced pork thigh or belly"
- " Salt"
- " Pepper"
- " Olive oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Tear each king oyster mushrooms vertically into 4 pieces and then wrap from the ends with a pork slice. Even if the meat tears during the wrapping process, squeeze the wrap at the end to secure."
- "Sprinkle salt and pepper evenly. Turn them over so that both sides are seasoned. Pour olive oil in a hot pan."
- "Saute over medium heat while turning, so both sides brown. It&#39;s better not to cover with a lid so that the water from the king oyster mushrooms will not come out."
- "Absorb excess oil with paper towels, and they&#39;re done. They&#39;re best when fresh and hot."
- "It&#39;s also good even when you use 2 tablespoons of yakiniku sauce instead of salt and pepper listed above. Wipe off the excess oil and add the sauce. Stir fry over high heat and mix well."
- "For bento, use ketchup and Japanese Worcestershire-style sauce. Make it the same way like in Step 5.  1 tablespoon of ketchup + 1 tablespoon of Japanese Worcestershire-style sauce."
- "A spicy variation.."
- "My husband pointed out, &#34;The drawback is that it&#39;s a bit difficult to bite through,&#34; so I started to make cuts in the sides of the mushrooms where they&#39;re covered with the meat. This way they are easy to eat!"
