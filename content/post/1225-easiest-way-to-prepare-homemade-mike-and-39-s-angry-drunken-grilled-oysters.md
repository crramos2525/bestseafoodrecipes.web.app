Great recipe for Mike&#39;s EZ Pappadeaux Grilled Oysters. The Grilled Oyster Company is a regionally inspired fresh seafood and raw bar with two locations in the Washington, D. Grilled oysters weren&#39;t really a thing in the Northeast, where I grew up, but they&#39;re a staple in the Gulf and Pacific states. The basic premise is simple: Shuck oysters, place on the grill, add a sauce, and In California, I&#39;ve seen oysters grilled with everything from barbecue sauce to cream and Champagne.
