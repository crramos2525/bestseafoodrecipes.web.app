As Mark Grinstein-Camacho mentions, if the ingredients are fresh and delicious on their own and the tempura is fried expertly in good oil, all you need is a little sea salt to enjoy Otherwise I concur with the already given answers - plain or flavoured ama-shio (or sea salt) is the way to go with tempura. They are also served over soba (Tempura Soba), udon (Tempura Udon) or served as a donburi dish.
