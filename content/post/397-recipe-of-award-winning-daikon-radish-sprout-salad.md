recipeinstructions:
- "Wash the sprouts well, and cut off the roots. Shred the crab sticks into thin strips."
- "Combine all the ◎ ingredients."
- "Add the sprouts to the combined sauce. Add salt and leave for about 10 minutes. At first the sauce won&#39;t blend well with the sprouts, as shown here."
- "In about 10 minutes, the sprouts will wilt and become saturated with the sauce."
- "Add the shredded crab sticks, and chill in the refrigerator."
- "Transfer to a serving plate, pour remaining sauce over it and serve."
- "If you let it rest overnight in a plastic container in the refrigerator, the flavors will blend together and become even more delicious. The version in the main photo was left to marinate overnight. The colors don&#39;t change that much, so you can make a large batch and serve it as an appetizer when guests come."
