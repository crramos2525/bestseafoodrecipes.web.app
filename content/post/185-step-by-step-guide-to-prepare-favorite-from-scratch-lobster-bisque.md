recipeinstructions:
- "Boil the lobsters in an 8 quart stock pot until they are red and pretty well cooked, between 10 and 15 minutes or so."
- "Reserve 10 cups of the boiling water, as this will be the base of the bisque."
- "Break down the lobster into meat and shells/carcasses, placing the shells back into the reserved water and setting aside the meat."
- "Boil the shells/carcasses about ten minutes, and then discard the shells/carcasses while saving the water."
- "Set the water aside, place the oil, butter, onion, carrot, celery, salt, bay, garlic, and cayenne into a large frying pan, and sweat it all out a bit.  Yes, it is a lot of butter, but bisque is buttery."

- "Add the veggie sludge to the lobster water, mix well, and simmer on medium low."
- "Add the tomato paste, and mix really well to get the blobs out."

- "Take a cup of the broth, let it cool a few minutes, and mix the cornstarch into it."
- "Add the cornstarch mixture back to the broth, mix it in, and then simmer and stir to thicken, for about 20 minutes or so."
- "Mince the lobster meat, and then add it to the broth.  Don&#39;t add it sooner, else you may create rubbery meat bits."
- "Serve immediately, though it might still be a bit thin.  It will thicken by the next day, though.  If I had you add more cornstarch, it would be all congealed by the next day."
