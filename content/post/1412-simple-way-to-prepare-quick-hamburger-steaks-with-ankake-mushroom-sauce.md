- "Tip: Turning off the heat once before putting in the hamburger patties ensures the patties will be evenly cooked, since they are all on the heat for the same length of time."
- "Tip: Make sure the patties are not too thick in the middle, or they won&#39;t cook through well.  Flatten them with your fingers after putting them in the frying pan."
- "Do not cover the pan with a lid because it will be hard to see how the meat is cooking, and the meat juices will also leak out. When they&#39;re a bit white around the edges, turn the patties over."
- "Tip: It&#39;s hard to tell from the photos, but if the meat turns a whitish color, it means it&#39;s cooked. If you cover the pan with a lid, you won&#39;t be able to tell if there&#39;s too much oil, and so on."

- "Slice the onion, cut the carrot into matchsticks, and cut the green pepper into strips. You can also use fresh mushrooms, instead of dried."

- "When the liquid in the pan comes to a boil, add the mirin, sugar and soy sauce."
- "Dissolve katakuriko in the same amount of water to make the slurry. Don&#39;t add it all at once, but slowly stir it in while shaking the frying pan."
- "Pour lots of the sauce on top of the hamburger steaks. This time I served them with deep-fried eggplant and boiled Morrocan beans."
