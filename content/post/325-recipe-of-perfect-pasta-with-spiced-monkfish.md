recipeingredient:
- "180 g pasta"
- "2 fillets monkfish"
- "2 tablespoons paprika"
- "1 tablespoon tumeric"
- "1 teaspoon cayenne pepper"
- " Water"
recipeinstructions:
- "Prepare a pot with abundant water to boil with a handful of corse salt. People never want to put enough salt as it seems too much to them - to me it&#39;s very normal. You need to consider that the pasta will be cooking in a lot of water for a very short time so for the salt to get into the pasta you need to be generous with the salt. When it boils, add the pasta and mix it until it start to boil again."
- "In a frying pan on medium heat put a little bit of olive oil, chop the monkfish into pieces and when it&#39;s gone from transparent to white add the spices and mix well so that it gets evenly coated. Add a little bit of water each time is dried out so that it creates a little brothy sauce. I heard that you can also use stock but I haven&#39;t tried it and I think that the spices are already adding flavour. Monkfish is delicious so you don&#39;t want to hide the flavour too much."
- "When the pasta is ready drain and add the pasta to the pan to coat it all together"
