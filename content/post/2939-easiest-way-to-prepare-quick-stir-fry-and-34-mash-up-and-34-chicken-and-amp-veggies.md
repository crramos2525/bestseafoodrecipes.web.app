In addition, heating up your food on the stovetop allows for mix-ins to be added to your leftovers, such as vegetables, a fried egg, additional meat, or sauces (teriyaki sauce works well with a chicken stir-fry). Veggies like bok choy, broccoli, carrots, or peppers work really well and help to add lots of flavor to your leftovers. Chicken Stir Fried Rice is a mash up between Chicken Stir Fry and a Veggie Fried Rice. Combining them together just gives you a one pan meal with little clean up, you feel me? I watched Sunny Anderson once make fried rice on her show on the Food Network.
