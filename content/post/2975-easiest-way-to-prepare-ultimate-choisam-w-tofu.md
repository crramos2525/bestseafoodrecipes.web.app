Stinky tofu (Chinese: 臭豆腐; pinyin: chòu dòufu) is a Chinese form of fermented tofu that has a strong odor. It is usually sold at night markets or roadside stands as a snack, or in lunch bars as a side dish. Though tofu often gets a bad rap in this country, it&#39;s so much more than a bland substitute for meat. I like to use firm tofu for this, silken ones will be super delicate to handle for this Cut the tofu again, into smaller pieces, so there&#39;s more surface area to develop that thicker fried tofu skin.
