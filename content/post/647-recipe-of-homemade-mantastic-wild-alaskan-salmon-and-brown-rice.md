- "Wait unil the rice has been cooking for around 20 minutes before you start cooking the thawed   Salmon."
- "In a frying pan on medium heat melt 4 tsp of butter. Let the butter heat for around 2 min and then put the salmon skin side up for 5 min. After 5 min flip the salmon and cook for an additional 5 min or until the salmon begins to flake. Note: Squeeze half of a fresh lemon over the salmon as it&#39;s cooking."

Take 1 tsp of butter and put it on top of the rice. Place the Salman on the rice. Take 1 tsp of butter and rub it all over the top of the salmon.  Squeeze 1/2 of the lemon over the salmon and finish with a dash of black pepper. Enjoy and remember, if you are buying salmon in Texas, the &#34;SECOND&#34; largest state in the country, it&#39;s not fresh Alaskan Caught Salmon."
