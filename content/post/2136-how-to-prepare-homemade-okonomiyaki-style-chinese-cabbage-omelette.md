- "1 Egg"
- "1 leaf Chinese cabbage medium"
- "2 Wiener sausages"
- "1 Mayonnaise and okonomiyaki sauce"
- "1 optional  Bonito flakes and red pickled ginger"
recipeinstructions:
- "This omelette is delicious even without bonito flakes. If you stir-fry the cabbage before cooking, it&#39;ll wilt and soften. This means that the okonomiyaki will lose its crunch."
- "Chop the Chinese cabbage up into 1 cm pieces and slice the sausage into whatever size you prefer."
- "Combine the sausage and cabbage with the beaten egg. If the pieces of cabbage are too big, the mixture will be difficult to mix."
- "Cook the omelette in a frying pan that has been greased with a thin layer of oil. Allow the omelette to cook slowly without interfering."
- "Once one side is cooked, flip the omelette over. You can cover the pan with a lid if you like, but the omelette will turn out just fine without it."
- "Slide the omelette onto a plate and pour over some mayonnaise and okonomiyaki sauce to serve."
- "If you have them, decorate the omelette with bonito flakes and red pickled ginger. It&#39;ll make the omelette look even more similar to okonomiyaki."
