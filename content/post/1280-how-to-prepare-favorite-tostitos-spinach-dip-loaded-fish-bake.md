I found the TOSTITOS spinach dip not nearly as good as the President&#39;s Choice one. now that&#39;s GOOD spinach dip!! If you like spinach dip, definitely try that one out. Especially the trendy multi-grain products like chips. And a lot of low fat products taste better because they are loaded with sugar. Set aside a baking sheet (greased or covered in parchment paper) for later.
