- "1 kg octopus"
- "1 jar olives chopped into pieces without the pip"
- " Oil"
- "5/6 juniper berries"
- "4 bay leaves"
- " Vinegar"
- " Salt"

recipeinstructions:
- "In a large pan bring water to boil with the juniper berries broke in half, the bay leaves, salt and a drop of white vinegar"
- "When it boils drop the octopus in the water by submerging it first 3/4 times as per video below. As you can see tentacles start to curl immediately with the hot water."
- "Submerge the octopus and leave it in the simmering water on low heat for about 30 min. Now the cooking time depends on the size of the octopus so I would suggest to start with a 30 min timer and then cook it longer if needed. You know that it’s ready when you can easily put a fork through the middle part of the octopus without needing force."
- "When ready remove it from the water and you can either simply chop it into pieces or if you want to remove some of the skin simply peel it out with your hands under cold water and then chop it"
- "Add olive oil, parsley, and lemon. Mix in the olives. You can keep it covered in the fridge and if you make it in advance, serve at room temperature."
