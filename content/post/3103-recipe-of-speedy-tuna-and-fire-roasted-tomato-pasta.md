Tuna Tomato Pasta is one of our favorite recipes to eat, period. Everything about it sounded iffy to her, but with a luscious homemade marinara, the proper Italian olive oil packed tuna, and plenty of capers. Add the tomatoes and season with salt and pepper. Freeze your chopped fire roasted tomatoes in a quart freezer bag for up to six months. (I like to stand a freezer bag up in a mug or small container to help hold it open while filling.) Note: The tomatoes will be very soft, so you&#39;ll be doing less chopping than smooshing and will be left with something in. Tasty roasted vegetables in tandem with StarKistÂ® Chunk Light Tuna in Water and pasta makes for a quick nutritious meal for the whole family.
