recipeingredient:
- "1 roughly 175 pound salmon fillet"
- " salt  pepper to season"
- "1 Tablespoon oil for searing salmon"
- "1 large clove garlic minced just under a Tablespoon"
- "2 Tablespoons shallots thinly sliced"
- "5-7 stems cilantro chopped stems and leaves"
- "1/2 a jalapeno thinly sliced or if you like hotter chilies you can certainly use another kind"
- "1 Tablespoon oil for the glaze"
- "3 Tablespoons maple syrup"
- " the zest of half a lime"
- "2 teaspoons chili garlic paste I use Huy Fong"
- "1 Tablespoon lime juice"
- "1.5 teaspoons fish sauce"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to 400F and prepare an oven safe dish or baking sheet to bake the salmon in. I like to line the dish with foil for easy removal and cleanup."
- "Season the salmon on the flesh side with salt and pepper."
- "In a medium bowl, combine all glaze ingredients and stir to mix thoroughly."
- "In a non-stick pan, bring the 1 Tablespoon oil up to medium high temp and sear the salmon fillet for 2 minutes per side. I sear because because I like a crust on my fish, but if you don&#39;t care for it or don&#39;t have time, just rub the flesh side with a little bit of oil and go to the next step."
- "Transfer the salmon to your oven-safe dish, skin-side down, and pour the glaze evenly on top."
- "Bake the salmon on the center rack for 7 to 10 minutes, depending on how done you like your fish (the full 10 minutes if you didn&#39;t sear), then turn the oven to broil and place the salmon about 5 inches under the broiler and broil for another 4 or 5 minutes to caramelize the glaze. You can serve the whole fillet family style, or portion it out with a knife or spatula, pulling the flesh away from the skin."
- "Enjoy!"
