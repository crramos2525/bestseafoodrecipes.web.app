It is a culinary dish prepared with stacked layers of pasta modified with sauces and ingredients such. From Italian lasagna (and its plural lasagne), possibly from Vulgar Latin *lasania, from Latin lasanum (&#34;cooking pot&#34;), from Ancient Greek λάσανον (lásanon, &#34;trivet or stand for a pot&#34;). Others argue the Italian lasagna originally derived from the Arabic لَوْزِينَج‎ (lawzīnaj, &#34;almond cake&#34;).

Classic Lasagna is great for feeding a crowd, and also freezes well for new mom meals and quick thaw dinners. I&#39;ve been making lasagna for a long time, and there are quite a few variables to play with. Lasagna has many versions, both within Italy and around the world, but when we talk about &#34;real&#34; lasagna in Italy we mean &#34;Lasagna alla Bolognese&#34; i.e., from Bologna in the region of Emilia-Romagna. Что такое лазанья - фото и фотографии. Lasagna Bolognese is a typical dish of Emilia Romagna, in particular of the city of Bologna.
